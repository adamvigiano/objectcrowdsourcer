He was the eldest son of Judith Crommelin and Samuel Verplanck (39.173). While attending Columbia College (formerly King's College), he married Elizabeth Johnson, daughter of the president of Columbia. They had two children. Following her death in 1789, Verplanck married Ann Walton, with whom he had seven children. They lived on Wall Street until 1803 and then moved to Fishkill-on-Hudson, New York. He represented Dutchess County in Congress from 1803 until 1809. The portrait was painted in 1771 when Daniel was nine years old. The background has traditionally been identified as a view from the Verplanck country house at Fishkill, looking toward Mount Gulian.","provenance":["The subject's son, Gulian Crommelin Verplanck, Fishkill, New York,  1834–died 1870","W.

She was born on the family manor, Rensselaerswyck, near  Albany, New York, and inherited a portion of her father's vast estate  in 1839. This picture was painted in 1842, the year before her  marriage to John Church Cruger, a prominent lawyer with whom she  settled on Cruger's Island near Barrytown, New York. Healy painted the  portrait in Paris, where he executed works for visiting Americans as  well as for the French king, Louis Philippe. He blends both lavish  detail and texture with a sensitive portrayal of character before a  setting suggestive of the Roman campagna from which the sitter had  just returned. The portrait, which shows the influence of the  German-born painter Franz Xavier Winterhalter, demonstrates a stunning  simplicity, grace, and vivacity rarely equalled in Healy's oeuvre.","provenance":["the sitter, died 1888","her daughter, Cornelia Cruger, by 1923"],"links":{"related-artworks":[{"href":"http://scrapi.org/object/11054"},{"href":"http://scrapi.org/object/11057"},{"href":"http://scrapi.org/object/11058"}],"related-content":[{"rel":"Interwoven Globe","href":"/exhibitions/listings/2013/interwoven-globe","date":"From September 16, 2013"},{"rel":"The American West in Bronze, 1850–1925","href":"/exhibitions/listings/2013/american-west","date":"From December 18, 2013"},{"rel":"American Paintings and Sculpture","href":"/events/programs/tours/american-paintings-and-sculpture?eid=R021_%7bF3242EF2-7D3B-4BC9-BFFC-FDE81F7A0B5B%7d_20131015120000","date":"October 15, 2013"},{"rel":"American Rooms, American Stories: 1680–1914","href":"/events/programs/tours/american-rooms-american-stories?eid=R016_%7b9E31413E-9AC9-4869-89AE-ADBF80821067%7d_20131015134500","date":"October 15, 2013"},{"rel":"Stillness and Movement in American Landscape Painting","href":"/events/programs/talks/gallery-talks/stillness-and-movement?eid=A002_%7bF319C208-9088-402C-B3AF-5288B770A4A0%7d_20130718115320","date":"October 16, 2013"},{"rel":"American Paintings and Sculpture","href":"/events/programs/tours/american-paintings-and-sculpture?eid=R022_%7bF3242EF2-7D3B-4BC9-BFFC-FDE81F7A0B5B%7d_20131016120000","date":"October 16, 2013"},{"rel":"American Rooms, American Stories: 1680–1914","href":"/events/programs/tours/american-rooms-american-stories?eid=R017_%7b9E31413E-9AC9-4869-89AE-ADBF80821067%7d_20131016134500","date":"October 16, 2013"},{"rel":"American Paintings and Sculpture","href":"/events/programs/tours/american-paintings-and-sculpture?eid=R023_%7bF3242EF2-7D3B-4BC9-BFFC-FDE81F7A0B5B%7d_20131017120000","date":"October 17, 2013"},{"rel":"American Rooms, American Stories: 1680–1914","href":"/events/programs/tours/american-rooms-american-stories?eid=R018_%7b9E31413E-9AC9-4869-89AE-ADBF80821067%7d_20131017134500","date":"October 17, 2013"},{"rel":"American Art","href":"/events/programs/tours/american-art-weekend?eid=R002_%7b501B6EDB-D4CC-4402-98B8-688E06337497%7d_20131019133000","date":"October 19, 2013"},{"rel":"Discoveries—Fanciful Fabrics (Ages 5–17)","href":"/events/programs/programs-for-visitors-with-disabilities/visitors-with-developmental-and-learning-disabilities/discoveries-family-fanciful-fabrics?eid=A002_%7b3FEA2506-DB5A-47EC-AA7E-2612A73B0DE4%7d_20130715115804","date":"October 20, 2013"},{"rel":"American Art","href":"/events/programs/tours/american-art-weekend?eid=A159_%7b501B6EDB-D4CC-4402-98B8-688E06337497%7d_20130729155856","date":"October 20, 2013"}],"self":{"href":"http://scrapi.org/object/11055"},"source":{"href":"http://www.metmuseum.org/Collections/search-the-collections/11055"}},"assigned_for_tagging":false,"tags":{"faces":[{"center_pos":{"value":[0.5475,0.31589147286821706],"user":"Adam.vigiano@gmail.com"}}]}}

His best groups are animated with an  exuberance that owes more to his affinity for contemporary sculpture in France, where he spent his mature years, than to his apprenticeship  with the American sculptor Augustus Saint-Gaudens.  Modeled in Paris \"Boy and Duck\" depicts a laughing boy delighting in his captured prize duck.  The duck and ducklings spout water from their open mouths, and the implied  noise and confusion of the moment are vividly evoked.  The theme of a nude boy struggling with a feisty animal extends back to the ancient art that MacMonnies so admired in Italy.  MacMonnies presented the first cast of this fountain figure as a gift to his native city of Brooklyn, New York, for the Vale of Cashmere in  Prospect Park.  This cast was stolen in 1941.  The Metropolitan's cast was purchased from the artist in 1922 and stands on a base of Sienna marble with applied bronze decoration.","provenance":["the artist, until 1922"],"links":{"related-artworks":[{"href":"http://scrapi.org/object/11479"},{"href":"http://scrapi.org/object/11476"},{"href":"http://scrapi.org/object/11482"},{"href":"http://scrapi.org/object/11491"},{"href":"http://scrapi.org/object/14537"}],"related-content":[{"rel":"Interwoven Globe","href":"/exhibitions/listings/2013/interwoven-globe","date":"From September 16, 2013"},{"rel":"The American West in Bronze, 1850–1925","href":"/exhibitions/listings/2013/american-west","date":"From December 18, 2013"},{"rel":"American Paintings and Sculpture","href":"/events/programs/tours/american-paintings-and-sculpture?eid=R021_%7bF3242EF2-7D3B-4BC9-BFFC-FDE81F7A0B5B%7d_20131015120000","date":"October 15, 2013"},{"rel":"American Rooms, American Stories: 1680–1914","href":"/events/programs/tours/american-rooms-american-stories?eid=R016_%7b9E31413E-9AC9-4869-89AE-ADBF80821067%7d_20131015134500","date":"October 15, 2013"},{"rel":"Stillness and Movement in American Landscape Painting","href":"/events/programs/talks/gallery-talks/stillness-and-movement?eid=A002_%7bF319C208-9088-402C-B3AF-5288B770A4A0%7d_20130718115320","date":"October 16, 2013"},{"rel":"American Paintings and Sculpture","href":"/events/programs/tours/american-paintings-and-sculpture?eid=R022_%7bF3242EF2-7D3B-4BC9-BFFC-FDE81F7A0B5B%7d_20131016120000","date":"October 16, 2013"},{"rel":"American Rooms, American Stories: 1680–1914","href":"/events/programs/tours/american-rooms-american-stories?eid=R017_%7b9E31413E-9AC9-4869-89AE-ADBF80821067%7d_20131016134500","date":"October 16, 2013"},{"rel":"American Paintings and Sculpture","href":"/events/programs/tours/american-paintings-and-sculpture?eid=R023_%7bF3242EF2-7D3B-4BC9-BFFC-FDE81F7A0B5B%7d_20131017120000","date":"October 17, 2013"},{"rel":"American Rooms, American Stories: 1680–1914","href":"/events/programs/tours/american-rooms-american-stories?eid=R018_%7b9E31413E-9AC9-4869-89AE-ADBF80821067%7d_20131017134500","date":"October 17, 2013"},{"rel":"American Art","href":"/events/programs/tours/american-art-weekend?eid=R002_%7b501B6EDB-D4CC-4402-98B8-688E06337497%7d_20131019133000","date":"October 19, 2013"},{"rel":"Discoveries—Fanciful Fabrics (Ages 5–17)","href":"/events/programs/programs-for-visitors-with-disabilities/visitors-with-developmental-and-learning-disabilities/discoveries-family-fanciful-fabrics?eid=A002_%7b3FEA2506-DB5A-47EC-AA7E-2612A73B0DE4%7d_20130715115804","date":"October 20, 2013"},{"rel":"American Art","href":"/events/programs/tours/american-art-weekend?eid=A159_%7b501B6EDB-D4CC-4402-98B8-688E06337497%7d_20130729155856","date":"October 20, 2013"},{"rel":"From Model to Monument: American Public Sculpture, 1865–1915","href":"http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/modl/hd_modl.htm","date":""},{"rel":"The United States and Canada, 1800–1900 A.D.","href":"http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/ht/?period=10®ion=na","date":""},{"rel":"The United States and Canada, 1900 A.D.–present","href":"http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/ht/?period=11®ion=na","date":""}],"self":{"href":"http://scrapi.org/object/11477"},"source":{"href":"http://www.metmuseum.org/Collections/search-the-collections/11477"}},"assigned_for_tagging":false,"tags":{"faces":[{"center_pos":{"value":[0.41732283464566927,0.18666666666666668],"user":"s"}}]}}

When she married Francis Brinley in 1718, she was a woman of wealth and social prominence. An entry in Smibert's notebook dated May 1729 identifies the infant as  the Brinley's son Francis (1729–1816). Mrs. Brinley holds a sprig of  orange blossoms, a gesture which may have been taken from an eighteenth-century print by Sir Peter Lely. The white orange blossom symbolizes both marriage and purity, while the fruit, a sign of fertility, emphasizes Mrs. Brinley's role as a mother.  Orange trees, although fashionable in Europe, were expensive rarities in the colonies. The presence of one here reinforces  the sitter's wealth.

Traveling extensively throughout Great Russia, she collected many fine examples of textile art of the wealthy peasant class. From the 1870s until moving to France in 1902, Shabelsky amassed a large collection of intricately embroidered hand-woven household textiles and opulent festival garments with rich decoration and elaborate motifs. The Brooklyn Museum holdings include many fine examples including the majority of the garments. Portions of Shabelsky's collection are also housed at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, the Cleveland Art Museum, and the Russian Museum of Ethnography in St. Petersburg.This forehead veil is known as a venchik. Married women were required to cover their hair lest they be considered immodest, and veils such as this were worn under headdresses.

Peter the Great's (1672-1725) attempts to Westernize Russia were partially manifested in changes to the traditional costume of the court. Though they were not required by law to adhere to the reformations, the peasant class commonly adopted aspects of Western styles blended with folk dress. This headdress in particular is an excellent example of the melding of cultures found in Russian history. The shape of this headdress is nearly identical to a French style from Alsace illustrated in Auguste Racinet's \"The Complete History of Costume\". This type of crossover is characteristic of the evolution of Russian dress.","links":{"related-artworks":[{"href":"http://scrapi.org/object/155779"},{"href":"http://scrapi.org/object/156134"},{"href":"http://scrapi.org/object/157073"},{"href":"http://scrapi.org/object/155783"},{"href":"http://scrapi.org/object/156460"}],"related-content":[{"rel":"Interwoven Globe","href":"/exhibitions/listings/2013/interwoven-globe","date":"From September 16, 2013"},{"rel":"Charles James: Beyond Fashion","href":"/exhibitions/listings/2014/charles-james","date":"From May 8, 2014"},{"rel":"Fashion in Art","href":"/events/programs/tours/fashion-in-art?eid=R026_%7b84F1FA41-DCF8-456F-B475-64003655E84E%7d_20131015130000","date":"October 15, 2013"},{"rel":"Fashion in Art","href":"/events/programs/tours/fashion-in-art?eid=R027_%7b84F1FA41-DCF8-456F-B475-64003655E84E%7d_20131016130000","date":"October 16, 2013"},{"rel":"Fashion in Art","href":"/events/programs/tours/fashion-in-art?eid=R028_%7b84F1FA41-DCF8-456F-B475-64003655E84E%7d_20131017130000","date":"October 17, 2013"},{"rel":"Fashion in Art","href":"/events/programs/tours/fashion-in-art?eid=R029_%7b84F1FA41-DCF8-456F-B475-64003655E84E%7d_20131018130000","date":"October 18, 2013"},{"rel":"Fashion in Art","href":"/events/programs/tours/fashion-in-art?eid=R030_%7b84F1FA41-DCF8-456F-B475-64003655E84E%7d_20131021130000","date":"October 21, 2013"},{"rel":"Fashion in Art","href":"/events/programs/tours/fashion-in-art?eid=R031_%7b84F1FA41-DCF8-456F-B475-64003655E84E%7d_20131022130000","date":"October 22, 2013"},{"rel":"Fashion in Art","href":"/events/programs/tours/fashion-in-art?eid=R032_%7b84F1FA41-DCF8-456F-B475-64003655E84E%7d_20131023130000","date":"October 23, 2013"},{"rel":"Fashion in Art","href":"/events/programs/tours/fashion-in-art?eid=R033_%7b84F1FA41-DCF8-456F-B475-64003655E84E%7d_20131024130000","date":"October 24, 2013"},{"rel":"Fashion in Art","href":"/events/programs/tours/fashion-in-art?eid=R034_%7b84F1FA41-DCF8-456F-B475-64003655E84E%7d_20131025130000","date":"October 25, 2013"},{"rel":"Fashion in Art","href":"/events/programs/tours/fashion-in-art?eid=R035_%7b84F1FA41-DCF8-456F-B475-64003655E84E%7d_20131028130000","date":"October 28, 2013"},{"rel":"Anatolia and the Caucasus, 1800–1900 A.D.","href":"http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/ht/?period=10®ion=waa","date":""},{"rel":"Central and North Asia, 1800–1900 A.D.","href":"http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/ht/?period=10®ion=nc","date":""},{"rel":"Eastern Europe and Scandinavia, 1800–1900 A.D.","href":"http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/ht/?period=10®ion=eue","date":""}],"self":{"href":"http://scrapi.org/object/155785"},"source":{"href":"http://www.metmuseum.org/Collections/search-the-collections/155785"}},"assigned_for_tagging":false,"tags":{"faces":[{"center_pos":{"value":[0.4022346368715084,0.8566666666666667],"user":"sueka"}},{"center_pos":{"value":[0.5446927374301676,0.8533333333333334],"user":"sueka"}}]}}

In 1772, the artist settled in Charleston, where he became the city's fashionable portraitist after Jeremiah Theus died in 1774.  This miniature exhibits Benbridge's colorful, linear, and crisply realistic portrait style, which is remarkably similar to that of John Singleton Copley. Dating from about 1770, it is one of the artist's earliest efforts in the medium, yet it shows more refinement than a number of his later works. The case, which is set with amethysts that match the gentleman's lavender waistcoat, is original to the piece.","provenance":["Private collection, England, until 1996"],"links":{"related-artworks":[{"href":"http://scrapi.org/object/10135"},{"href":"http://scrapi.org/object/10139"},{"href":"http://scrapi.org/object/10136"},{"href":"http://scrapi.org/object/10138"}],"related-content":[{"rel":"Interwoven Globe","href":"/exhibitions/listings/2013/interwoven-globe","date":"From September 16, 2013"},{"rel":"The American West in Bronze, 1850–1925","href":"/exhibitions/listings/2013/american-west","date":"From December 18, 2013"},{"rel":"Welcome and Introduction","href":"/events/programs/lectures-and-panels/free-lectures/welcome-interwoven?eid=A001_%7bF67F8602-11A0-4AAC-B8A7-093B4933B961%7d_20130726182229","date":"October 4, 2013"},{"rel":"Ottoman Turkish Silks in Italian and Russian Trade and Diplomacy","href":"/events/programs/lectures-and-panels/free-lectures/ottoman-turkish-silks?eid=A001_%7b0E2BB95D-786B-4EA8-B921-EE58F5363859%7d_20130726183437","date":"October 4, 2013"},{"rel":"The Dutch East India Company and Asian Raw Silk: From Iran to Bengal via China and Japan","href":"/events/programs/lectures-and-panels/free-lectures/dutch-east-india-company?eid=A001_%7b25382F31-42A6-4113-A7A9-41DCFA7E9A8F%7d_20130726184825","date":"October 4, 2013"},{"rel":"Textiles, Trade, and Taste: Portugal and Asia in the Sixteenth and Seventeenth Centuries","href":"/events/programs/lectures-and-panels/free-lectures/textiles-trade-taste?eid=A001_%7b55BC89B9-7FDA-4450-856C-7836B221BDB4%7d_20130726185922","date":"October 4, 2013"},{"rel":"The International Expansion of Textiles with Flower, Bird, and Animal Designs","href":"/events/programs/lectures-and-panels/free-lectures/international-expansion-of-textiles?eid=A001_%7bFAC89C4E-4C33-4E8D-AD07-B22980BCD28B%7d_20130726190419","date":"October 4, 2013"},{"rel":"Aspects of the Luxury Trade in Indian Chintzes for the Dutch Market","href":"/events/programs/lectures-and-panels/free-lectures/aspects-of-the-luxury-trade?eid=A001_%7bC5061B94-C194-4E16-99BE-17C4C42F5593%7d_20130726190941","date":"October 4, 2013"},{"rel":"East Meets West: Everyday Fashion in Eighteenth-Century London","href":"/events/programs/lectures-and-panels/free-lectures/east-meets-west?eid=A001_%7bA1DB9C92-C4EB-4BD1-8388-A20CA48EE7A4%7d_20130726191448","date":"October 4, 2013"},{"rel":"Lost and Found in Translation: West African Textiles and Atlantic Trade","href":"/events/programs/lectures-and-panels/free-lectures/lost-and-found?eid=A001_%7b466F3CD5-95EE-4657-A604-C562921D16F1%7d_20130726192013","date":"October 4, 2013"},{"rel":"Popular and Prevalent: The Impact of Asian Textiles on Colonial Mexico","href":"/events/programs/lectures-and-panels/free-lectures/popular-and-prevalent?eid=A001_%7bC03782D5-2CA0-4C3E-AB56-18B084507F87%7d_20130726192450","date":"October 4, 2013"},{"rel":"Block Printing: Pattern and Print on Fabric","href":"/events/programs/art-making-programs/studio-workshops/block-printing?eid=A001_%7b703C4B65-68A8-43E6-8BF5-B6D03B4BDF11%7d_20130717174903","date":"October 6, 2013"},{"rel":"American Portrait Miniatures of the Eighteenth Century","href":"http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/mini/hd_mini.htm","date":""},{"rel":"Art and Identity in the British North American Colonies, 1700–1776","href":"http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/arid/hd_arid.htm","date":""},{"rel":"The United States, 1600–1800 A.D.","href":"http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/ht/?period=09®ion=na","date":""}],"self":{"href":"/object/15588"},"source":{"href":"http://www.metmuseum.org/Collections/search-the-collections/15588"}},"assigned_for_tagging":false,"tags":{"faces":[{"center_pos":{"value":[0.5325,0.501002004008016],"user":"Francisco"}}]}}

Portions of Shabelsky's collection are also housed at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, the Cleveland Art Museum, and the Russian Museum of Ethnography in St. Petersburg.(a) Traditional Russian costume consists of straight, flowing lines. Beginning at the turn of the 18th century, the sarafan, a long, sleeveless dress, became the most popular article of peasant women's clothing in the Northern and Central regions of Russia. The motif on this sarafan includes strawberries, a significant symbol in folklore. The strawberry denotes purity and modesty, as well as fertility and abundance.(b) In the 18th century the sarafan, the long sleeveless dress seen here became the most prevalent form of women's clothing among the peasant class of Northern and Central Russia. The shirt worn under the sarafan is unique for its extremely long sleeves gathered onto the wrist. Together with the traditional headdress the ensemble makes a bold statement with its contrasting red and blue and generous gold ornamentation.(c) Married women were required to cover their hair entirely lest they be considered immodest; they wore fatas, usually a white muslin veil woven with silk floral designs and gold embroidery such as this. These were sometimes worn with a headdress, or kokoshnik. The traditional wedding customs that were practiced widely in the 16th century and lasted in some remote areas into the early 20th century placed great importance on needlework. Young women often began years before their marriage to produce the collection of textiles that would be presented as gifts to their future husband and his family. These gifts offered proof of the maiden's skill and industriousness to her future family, and consisted mostly of towels with wide embroidered borders and chirinkas, or embroidered pocket handkerchiefs.","links":{"related-artworks":[{"href":"http://scrapi.org/object/157136"},{"href":"http://scrapi.org/object/175012"},{"href":"http://scrapi.org/object/159164"},{"href":"http://scrapi.org/object/157886"},{"href":"http://scrapi.org/object/157890"}],"related-content":[{"rel":"Interwoven Globe","href":"/exhibitions/listings/2013/interwoven-globe","date":"From September 16, 2013"},{"rel":"Charles James: Beyond Fashion","href":"/exhibitions/listings/2014/charles-james","date":"From May 8, 2014"},{"rel":"Fashion in Art","href":"/events/programs/tours/fashion-in-art?eid=R026_%7b84F1FA41-DCF8-456F-B475-64003655E84E%7d_20131015130000","date":"October 15, 2013"},{"rel":"Fashion in Art","href":"/events/programs/tours/fashion-in-art?eid=R027_%7b84F1FA41-DCF8-456F-B475-64003655E84E%7d_20131016130000","date":"October 16, 2013"},{"rel":"Fashion in Art","href":"/events/programs/tours/fashion-in-art?eid=R028_%7b84F1FA41-DCF8-456F-B475-64003655E84E%7d_20131017130000","date":"October 17, 2013"},{"rel":"Fashion in Art","href":"/events/programs/tours/fashion-in-art?eid=R029_%7b84F1FA41-DCF8-456F-B475-64003655E84E%7d_20131018130000","date":"October 18, 2013"},{"rel":"Fashion in Art","href":"/events/programs/tours/fashion-in-art?eid=R030_%7b84F1FA41-DCF8-456F-B475-64003655E84E%7d_20131021130000","date":"October 21, 2013"},{"rel":"Fashion in Art","href":"/events/programs/tours/fashion-in-art?eid=R031_%7b84F1FA41-DCF8-456F-B475-64003655E84E%7d_20131022130000","date":"October 22, 2013"},{"rel":"Fashion in Art","href":"/events/programs/tours/fashion-in-art?eid=R032_%7b84F1FA41-DCF8-456F-B475-64003655E84E%7d_20131023130000","date":"October 23, 2013"},{"rel":"Fashion in Art","href":"/events/programs/tours/fashion-in-art?eid=R033_%7b84F1FA41-DCF8-456F-B475-64003655E84E%7d_20131024130000","date":"October 24, 2013"},{"rel":"Fashion in Art","href":"/events/programs/tours/fashion-in-art?eid=R034_%7b84F1FA41-DCF8-456F-B475-64003655E84E%7d_20131025130000","date":"October 25, 2013"},{"rel":"Fashion in Art","href":"/events/programs/tours/fashion-in-art?eid=R035_%7b84F1FA41-DCF8-456F-B475-64003655E84E%7d_20131028130000","date":"October 28, 2013"},{"rel":"Anatolia and the Caucasus, 1800–1900 A.D.","href":"http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/ht/?period=10®ion=waa","date":""},{"rel":"Central and North Asia, 1800–1900 A.D.","href":"http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/ht/?period=10®ion=nc","date":""},{"rel":"Eastern Europe and Scandinavia, 1800–1900 A.D.","href":"http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/ht/?period=10®ion=eue","date":""}],"self":{"href":"http://scrapi.org/object/157135"},"source":{"href":"http://www.metmuseum.org/Collections/search-the-collections/157135"}},"assigned_for_tagging":false,"tags":{"faces":[{"center_pos":{"value":[0.4732824427480916,0.24],"user":"tloong@gmail.com"}}]}}

Among his students and disciples were many artists who came to maturity between 1910 and 1930, including George Bellows, Rockwell Kent, Eugene Speicher, Patrick Henry Bruce, Glenn Coleman, Morgan Russell, Stuart Davis, and John Sloan.Henri's approach to realism was influenced by his studies at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts with Thomas Anshutz, a pupil and an assistant of Thomas Eakins who took over the latter's classes after he was dismissed.  Their disavowal of traditional subject matter derived from history, literature, and mythology and their tendency to analyze nature objectively shaped Henri's own philosophy.  After three years of study in Europe, where he was impressed more by the work of Manet, Velázquez, and Hals than by late Impressionism, Henri returned to Philadelphia, where he met Sloan, William Glackens, George Luks, and Everett Shinn, all of whom were working as artist-reporters or illustrators at various Philadelphia newspapers.  Their interaction — a merging of Henri's painterly technique with the keen observation and social focus of newspaper illustration — resulted in the artistic philosophy of this group.  \"The Eight,\" who espoused \"art for life's sake,\" gravitated to New York at the beginning of the twentieth century, becoming embroiled in conflicts with the prevailing academic attitudes in painting, a struggle that coalesced in their famous exhibition at Macbeth Gallery in 1908.Henri's work was imbued with social awareness, and The Eight were, in general, especially attuned to the economic plight of urbanized society, with its influx of newly arrived immigrants struggling to survive.  Although he painted a few street scenes and landscapes, it was in the closely observed, penetrating portraits of individuals that Henri excelled.  One of his favorite models was his wife, whom he painted in the work shown here.   Mrs. Henri, who posed for her husband often, was herself an artist, known for her graphic work and watercolors, which she exhibited under her maiden name, Marjorie Organ.  The portrait demonstrates Henri's typical directness of presentation.  His wife stands with one foot forward, one arm slightly extended, looking out of the canvas as if she were about to curtsy to the viewer.  The elegance of her figure is emphasized by the verticality of the composition.  There is nothing to look at but the subject, no interest in the background except as it serves to throw the figure into relief.  Thanks to Henri's mastery of shorthand indications, the texture of the paint that represents the dress exactly simulates the material.","links":{"related-artworks":[{"href":"http://scrapi.org/object/19226"},{"href":"http://scrapi.org/object/19247"},{"href":"http://scrapi.org/object/19260"},{"href":"http://scrapi.org/object/19303"},{"href":"http://scrapi.org/object/19321"}],"related-content":[{"rel":"Interwoven Globe","href":"/exhibitions/listings/2013/interwoven-globe","date":"From September 16, 2013"},{"rel":"The American West in Bronze, 1850–1925","href":"/exhibitions/listings/2013/american-west","date":"From December 18, 2013"},{"rel":"American Paintings and Sculpture","href":"/events/programs/tours/american-paintings-and-sculpture?eid=R021_%7bF3242EF2-7D3B-4BC9-BFFC-FDE81F7A0B5B%7d_20131015120000","date":"October 15, 2013"},{"rel":"American Rooms, American Stories: 1680–1914","href":"/events/programs/tours/american-rooms-american-stories?eid=R016_%7b9E31413E-9AC9-4869-89AE-ADBF80821067%7d_20131015134500","date":"October 15, 2013"},{"rel":"Stillness and Movement in American Landscape Painting","href":"/events/programs/talks/gallery-talks/stillness-and-movement?eid=A002_%7bF319C208-9088-402C-B3AF-5288B770A4A0%7d_20130718115320","date":"October 16, 2013"},{"rel":"American Paintings and Sculpture","href":"/events/programs/tours/american-paintings-and-sculpture?eid=R022_%7bF3242EF2-7D3B-4BC9-BFFC-FDE81F7A0B5B%7d_20131016120000","date":"October 16, 2013"},{"rel":"American Rooms, American Stories: 1680–1914","href":"/events/programs/tours/american-rooms-american-stories?eid=R017_%7b9E31413E-9AC9-4869-89AE-ADBF80821067%7d_20131016134500","date":"October 16, 2013"},{"rel":"American Paintings and Sculpture","href":"/events/programs/tours/american-paintings-and-sculpture?eid=R023_%7bF3242EF2-7D3B-4BC9-BFFC-FDE81F7A0B5B%7d_20131017120000","date":"October 17, 2013"},{"rel":"American Rooms, American Stories: 1680–1914","href":"/events/programs/tours/american-rooms-american-stories?eid=R018_%7b9E31413E-9AC9-4869-89AE-ADBF80821067%7d_20131017134500","date":"October 17, 2013"},{"rel":"American Art","href":"/events/programs/tours/american-art-weekend?eid=R002_%7b501B6EDB-D4CC-4402-98B8-688E06337497%7d_20131019133000","date":"October 19, 2013"},{"rel":"Discoveries—Fanciful Fabrics (Ages 5–17)","href":"/events/programs/programs-for-visitors-with-disabilities/visitors-with-developmental-and-learning-disabilities/discoveries-family-fanciful-fabrics?eid=A002_%7b3FEA2506-DB5A-47EC-AA7E-2612A73B0DE4%7d_20130715115804","date":"October 20, 2013"},{"rel":"American Art","href":"/events/programs/tours/american-art-weekend?eid=A159_%7b501B6EDB-D4CC-4402-98B8-688E06337497%7d_20130729155856","date":"October 20, 2013"},{"rel":"The Ashcan School","href":"http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/ashc/hd_ashc.htm","date":""},{"rel":"The United States and Canada, 1900 A.D.–present","href":"http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/ht/?period=11®ion=na","date":""}],"self":{"href":"http://scrapi.org/object/19322"},"source":{"href":"http://www.metmuseum.org/Collections/search-the-collections/19322"}},"assigned_for_tagging":false,"tags":{"faces":[{"center_pos":{"value":[0.5085910652920962,0.21833333333333332],"user":"dawn barber"}}]}}

It is stylistically similar to a number of bronzes representing antique and modern genre subjects that include a praying boy, a woman cutting her nails, and a crouching woman with a peeing child. The female figure's pose, seated on a draped pedestal with crossed legs, is closely related to a bronze statuette of a crouching nymph pulling a thorn from her foot in the Victoria and Albert Museum. The fluid lines of the figure's composition, including its elongated torso and attenuated legs, observe the canon of proportion popularized in northern France by the engravings of the School of Fontainebleau. The statue's oval face, with its rounded forehead and long nose, suggests it is the work of Barthélemy Prieur, active bronzier and court sculptor to Henri IV of France. Prieur is believed to have modeled a number of genre subjects drawn from rural life, and his workshop produced numerous small bronze figures similar to Girl Braiding Her Hair. Unlike many of the bronzes attributed to him, this statuette does not reference the antique. Although nude, the figure conveys a spirit of innocence.","links":{"related-artworks":[{"href":"http://scrapi.org/object/207028"},{"href":"http://scrapi.org/object/197042"},{"href":"http://scrapi.org/object/205098"},{"href":"http://scrapi.org/object/191166"},{"href":"http://scrapi.org/object/195185"}],"related-content":[{"rel":"Fabergé from the Matilda Geddings Gray Foundation Collection","href":"/exhibitions/listings/2011/faberge","date":"From November 22, 2011"},{"rel":"Furniture by Abraham and David Roentgen on loan from the Kunstgewerbemuseum, Staatliche Museen zu Berlin","href":"/exhibitions/listings/2013/roentgen-furniture","date":"From January 29, 2013"},{"rel":"Great Rooms: European Decorative Arts","href":"/events/programs/tours/great-rooms-european-decorative-arts?eid=R021_%7b1FF4F144-6903-47E8-865E-07D6E918D7EF%7d_20131015131500","date":"October 15, 2013"},{"rel":"Gallery Talk and Demonstration—Roentgen Furniture","href":"/events/programs/talks/gallery-talks/demonstration-roentgen-furniture?eid=A005_%7b3A04B53C-5C03-4947-B283-F631460D3AA0%7d_20130716175638","date":"October 15, 2013"},{"rel":"Great Rooms: European Decorative Arts","href":"/events/programs/tours/great-rooms-european-decorative-arts?eid=R022_%7b1FF4F144-6903-47E8-865E-07D6E918D7EF%7d_20131017131500","date":"October 17, 2013"},{"rel":"Great Rooms: European Decorative Arts","href":"/events/programs/tours/great-rooms-european-decorative-arts?eid=R023_%7b1FF4F144-6903-47E8-865E-07D6E918D7EF%7d_20131018131500","date":"October 18, 2013"},{"rel":"Discoveries—Fanciful Fabrics (Ages 5–17)","href":"/events/programs/programs-for-visitors-with-disabilities/visitors-with-developmental-and-learning-disabilities/discoveries-family-fanciful-fabrics?eid=A002_%7b3FEA2506-DB5A-47EC-AA7E-2612A73B0DE4%7d_20130715115804","date":"October 20, 2013"},{"rel":"Block Printing: Pattern and Print on Fabric","href":"/events/programs/art-making-programs/studio-workshops/block-printing?eid=A003_%7b703C4B65-68A8-43E6-8BF5-B6D03B4BDF11%7d_20130717174945","date":"October 20, 2013"},{"rel":"Discoveries—Fanciful Fabrics (Ages 18 and above)","href":"/events/programs/programs-for-visitors-with-disabilities/visitors-with-developmental-and-learning-disabilities/discoveries-fanciful-fabrics?eid=A002_%7bE66EFA97-F571-4875-94B5-369808099CE8%7d_20130715144524","date":"October 20, 2013"},{"rel":"Great Rooms: European Decorative Arts","href":"/events/programs/tours/great-rooms-european-decorative-arts?eid=R024_%7b1FF4F144-6903-47E8-865E-07D6E918D7EF%7d_20131021131500","date":"October 21, 2013"},{"rel":"Great Rooms: European Decorative Arts","href":"/events/programs/tours/great-rooms-european-decorative-arts?eid=R025_%7b1FF4F144-6903-47E8-865E-07D6E918D7EF%7d_20131022131500","date":"October 22, 2013"},{"rel":"Cultural Discoveries—Wednesdays with Olivier Bernier: Royal Luxuries","href":"/events/programs/membership-events/classes-for-adults/royal-luxuries?eid=R001_%7b5660A3E0-C0D8-40DC-84F5-7225FB25DEBB%7d_20131023100000","date":"October 23, 2013"},{"rel":"Pastoral Charms in the French Renaissance","href":"http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/past/hd_past.htm","date":""},{"rel":"France, 1600–1800 A.D.","href":"http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/ht/?period=09®ion=euwf","date":""}],"self":{"href":"http://scrapi.org/object/207029"},"source":{"href":"http://www.metmuseum.org/Collections/search-the-collections/207029"}},"assigned_for_tagging":false,"tags":{"faces":[{"center_pos":{"value":[0.5607235142118863,0.16833333333333333],"user":"anamarva@gmail.com"}}]}}

B. Foggini, the leading sculptor of the Florentine Baroque. While strong echoes of Bernini date the creation of the pair to shortly after the younger artist's return from Rome, they already exhibit Foggini's talent for the depiction of material opulence that earned him the post of Medici court sculptor. Dynamic contrasts abound: the fragile lace cravats and lavish mantles (emulating modes of the contemporary French court) set off the realistically depicted faces. They in turn provide their own study in contrasts: the commanding pose and classic Habsburg physiognomy of the balding father serve as counterpoint to the sweet, somewhat unformed face of the youth, overwhelmed by a delirious cascade of curls. Foggini's artistic genius inaugurated the final flourish of Medici patronage. These busts, modeled from life, were followed by a series portraying other family members, all intended to promote the political aspirations of the fading dynasty. Their acquisition served to link our major series of Roman Baroque portrait busts to a growing collection of stunning small-scale Florentine sculptures of that period.","provenance":["possibly Prince Francesco Maria de' Medici for Villa Lâppeggi at Bagno a Ripoli","Palazzo Covoni","[ Stefano Bardini , on loan to Gemäldegalerie, Berlin, until 1895 ]","Prince Karl Egon IV zu Fürstenberg , Donaueschingen, Germany (1895–d. 1896)","descended in the family of the Princess Fürstenberg (until 1993)","[ Alain Moatti , 1993","sold to MMA ]"],"links":{"related-artworks":[{"href":"http://scrapi.org/object/208149"},{"href":"http://scrapi.org/object/203003"},{"href":"http://scrapi.org/object/207676"},{"href":"http://scrapi.org/object/208847"},{"href":"http://scrapi.org/object/338730"}],"related-content":[{"rel":"Fabergé from the Matilda Geddings Gray Foundation Collection","href":"/exhibitions/listings/2011/faberge","date":"From November 22, 2011"},{"rel":"Furniture by Abraham and David Roentgen on loan from the Kunstgewerbemuseum, Staatliche Museen zu Berlin","href":"/exhibitions/listings/2013/roentgen-furniture","date":"From January 29, 2013"},{"rel":"Welcome and Introduction","href":"/events/programs/lectures-and-panels/free-lectures/welcome-interwoven?eid=A001_%7bF67F8602-11A0-4AAC-B8A7-093B4933B961%7d_20130726182229","date":"October 4, 2013"},{"rel":"Ottoman Turkish Silks in Italian and Russian Trade and Diplomacy","href":"/events/programs/lectures-and-panels/free-lectures/ottoman-turkish-silks?eid=A001_%7b0E2BB95D-786B-4EA8-B921-EE58F5363859%7d_20130726183437","date":"October 4, 2013"},{"rel":"The Dutch East India Company and Asian Raw Silk: From Iran to Bengal via China and Japan","href":"/events/programs/lectures-and-panels/free-lectures/dutch-east-india-company?eid=A001_%7b25382F31-42A6-4113-A7A9-41DCFA7E9A8F%7d_20130726184825","date":"October 4, 2013"},{"rel":"Textiles, Trade, and Taste: Portugal and Asia in the Sixteenth and Seventeenth Centuries","href":"/events/programs/lectures-and-panels/free-lectures/textiles-trade-taste?eid=A001_%7b55BC89B9-7FDA-4450-856C-7836B221BDB4%7d_20130726185922","date":"October 4, 2013"},{"rel":"The International Expansion of Textiles with Flower, Bird, and Animal Designs","href":"/events/programs/lectures-and-panels/free-lectures/international-expansion-of-textiles?eid=A001_%7bFAC89C4E-4C33-4E8D-AD07-B22980BCD28B%7d_20130726190419","date":"October 4, 2013"},{"rel":"Great Rooms: European Decorative Arts","href":"/events/programs/tours/great-rooms-european-decorative-arts?eid=R015_%7b1FF4F144-6903-47E8-865E-07D6E918D7EF%7d_20131004131500","date":"October 4, 2013"},{"rel":"Aspects of the Luxury Trade in Indian Chintzes for the Dutch Market","href":"/events/programs/lectures-and-panels/free-lectures/aspects-of-the-luxury-trade?eid=A001_%7bC5061B94-C194-4E16-99BE-17C4C42F5593%7d_20130726190941","date":"October 4, 2013"},{"rel":"East Meets West: Everyday Fashion in Eighteenth-Century London","href":"/events/programs/lectures-and-panels/free-lectures/east-meets-west?eid=A001_%7bA1DB9C92-C4EB-4BD1-8388-A20CA48EE7A4%7d_20130726191448","date":"October 4, 2013"},{"rel":"Lost and Found in Translation: West African Textiles and Atlantic Trade","href":"/events/programs/lectures-and-panels/free-lectures/lost-and-found?eid=A001_%7b466F3CD5-95EE-4657-A604-C562921D16F1%7d_20130726192013","date":"October 4, 2013"},{"rel":"Popular and Prevalent: The Impact of Asian Textiles on Colonial Mexico","href":"/events/programs/lectures-and-panels/free-lectures/popular-and-prevalent?eid=A001_%7bC03782D5-2CA0-4C3E-AB56-18B084507F87%7d_20130726192450","date":"October 4, 2013"},{"rel":"The Piano: The Pianofortes of Bartolomeo Cristofori (1655–1731)","href":"http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/cris/hd_cris.htm","date":""},{"rel":"Florence and Central Italy, 1600–1800 A.D.","href":"http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/ht/?period=09®ion=eustc","date":""}],"self":{"href":"/object/208148"},"source":{"href":"http://www.metmuseum.org/Collections/search-the-collections/208148"}},"assigned_for_tagging":false,"tags":{"faces":[{"center_pos":{"value":[0.48,0.3215686274509804],"user":"thomp22000@gmail.com"}}]}}

It dates to the first quarter of the eighteenth century and bears the coat of arms of King George I (r. 1714–27). The design probably originated during the early seventeenth century and burses of nearly identical format appear in portraits of the Lord High Chancellors of England well into the nineteenth century. The earliest extant example dates from the time of Charles I (r. 1625–49).Several types of metal threads, plus colored silks, cabochon garnets, and pearls, were used in the creation of this piece. The coat of arms is supported by two intricately detailed beasts, a lion and a unicorn, and these are surrounded by cherubim. The bag has a drawstring closure using cords of silk and metal thread and ending in tassels; four larger tassels decorate the bottom.The king of England traditionally employed an embroiderer, responsible for organizing embroidery projects required by the king and his court. His tasks included presenting designs to the king, procuring supplies, and performing the actual work. The embroiderer decorated both furnishings and costume, as well as horse trappings and ceremonial decorations. For large projects, such as the preparation for a state function, he would have to hire additional workers to assist him with decorations like banners, hangings, and uniforms for the participants.","provenance":["Irwin Untermyer , New York (until 1964)"],"links":{"related-artworks":[{"href":"http://scrapi.org/object/221457"},{"href":"http://scrapi.org/object/229862"},{"href":"http://scrapi.org/object/221410"},{"href":"http://scrapi.org/object/221632"},{"href":"http://scrapi.org/object/226318"}],"related-content":[{"rel":"Fabergé from the Matilda Geddings Gray Foundation Collection","href":"/exhibitions/listings/2011/faberge","date":"From November 22, 2011"},{"rel":"Furniture by Abraham and David Roentgen on loan from the Kunstgewerbemuseum, Staatliche Museen zu Berlin","href":"/exhibitions/listings/2013/roentgen-furniture","date":"From January 29, 2013"},{"rel":"Great Rooms: European Decorative Arts","href":"/events/programs/tours/great-rooms-european-decorative-arts?eid=R021_%7b1FF4F144-6903-47E8-865E-07D6E918D7EF%7d_20131015131500","date":"October 15, 2013"},{"rel":"Gallery Talk and Demonstration—Roentgen Furniture","href":"/events/programs/talks/gallery-talks/demonstration-roentgen-furniture?eid=A005_%7b3A04B53C-5C03-4947-B283-F631460D3AA0%7d_20130716175638","date":"October 15, 2013"},{"rel":"Great Rooms: European Decorative Arts","href":"/events/programs/tours/great-rooms-european-decorative-arts?eid=R022_%7b1FF4F144-6903-47E8-865E-07D6E918D7EF%7d_20131017131500","date":"October 17, 2013"},{"rel":"Great Rooms: European Decorative Arts","href":"/events/programs/tours/great-rooms-european-decorative-arts?eid=R023_%7b1FF4F144-6903-47E8-865E-07D6E918D7EF%7d_20131018131500","date":"October 18, 2013"},{"rel":"Discoveries—Fanciful Fabrics (Ages 5–17)","href":"/events/programs/programs-for-visitors-with-disabilities/visitors-with-developmental-and-learning-disabilities/discoveries-family-fanciful-fabrics?eid=A002_%7b3FEA2506-DB5A-47EC-AA7E-2612A73B0DE4%7d_20130715115804","date":"October 20, 2013"},{"rel":"Block Printing: Pattern and Print on Fabric","href":"/events/programs/art-making-programs/studio-workshops/block-printing?eid=A003_%7b703C4B65-68A8-43E6-8BF5-B6D03B4BDF11%7d_20130717174945","date":"October 20, 2013"},{"rel":"Discoveries—Fanciful Fabrics (Ages 18 and above)","href":"/events/programs/programs-for-visitors-with-disabilities/visitors-with-developmental-and-learning-disabilities/discoveries-fanciful-fabrics?eid=A002_%7bE66EFA97-F571-4875-94B5-369808099CE8%7d_20130715144524","date":"October 20, 2013"},{"rel":"Great Rooms: European Decorative Arts","href":"/events/programs/tours/great-rooms-european-decorative-arts?eid=R024_%7b1FF4F144-6903-47E8-865E-07D6E918D7EF%7d_20131021131500","date":"October 21, 2013"},{"rel":"Great Rooms: European Decorative Arts","href":"/events/programs/tours/great-rooms-european-decorative-arts?eid=R025_%7b1FF4F144-6903-47E8-865E-07D6E918D7EF%7d_20131022131500","date":"October 22, 2013"},{"rel":"Cultural Discoveries—Wednesdays with Olivier Bernier: Royal Luxuries","href":"/events/programs/membership-events/classes-for-adults/royal-luxuries?eid=R001_%7b5660A3E0-C0D8-40DC-84F5-7225FB25DEBB%7d_20131023100000","date":"October 23, 2013"},{"rel":"Great Britain and Ireland, 1600–1800 A.D.","href":"http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/ht/?period=09®ion=euwb","date":""}],"self":{"href":"http://scrapi.org/object/229059"},"source":{"href":"http://www.metmuseum.org/Collections/search-the-collections/229059"}},"assigned_for_tagging":false,"tags":{"faces":[{"center_pos":{"value":[0.4725,0.6397748592870544],"user":"Francisco"}}]}}

His smile and the jewel-like precision with which his hair and beard are carved remind one of Greek Archaic art of the sixth century B.C., but the style appears stiff and somewhat artificial in this statue, which was carved in the second quarter of the fifth century.     Like many Cypriot votive statues this figure wears a wreath of leaves and flowers. It is composed of oak leaves and stylized narcissus flowers, which must have evoked ideas of fertility and regeneration. The man holds gifts for the deity—a dove in his left hand and a cylindrical object, which probably represented a container of incense, in his right hand.","provenance":["Sanctuary of Golgoi–Ayios Photios"],"links":{"related-artworks":[{"href":"http://scrapi.org/object/242010"},{"href":"http://scrapi.org/object/242008"},{"href":"http://scrapi.org/object/242011"},{"href":"http://scrapi.org/object/242009"},{"href":"http://scrapi.org/object/242012"}],"related-content":[{"rel":"Arts of Ancient Greece and Rome","href":"/events/programs/tours/arts-ancient-greece-rome?eid=R015_%7bF428DBBF-911D-47C3-BF37-47C3F3F2E51E%7d_20131004123000","date":"October 4, 2013"},{"rel":"Stone and Metal: Etruscan Art","href":"/events/programs/family-programs/sunday-studio/stone-and-metal?eid=A001_%7bC5DE7A07-5D55-4413-9233-A4C1E8A0E912%7d_20130722153815","date":"October 6, 2013"},{"rel":"Arts of Ancient Greece and Rome","href":"/events/programs/tours/arts-ancient-greece-rome?eid=A126_%7bF428DBBF-911D-47C3-BF37-47C3F3F2E51E%7d_20130812100612","date":"October 6, 2013"},{"rel":"Arts of Ancient Greece and Rome","href":"/events/programs/tours/arts-ancient-greece-rome?eid=R016_%7bF428DBBF-911D-47C3-BF37-47C3F3F2E51E%7d_20131007123000","date":"October 7, 2013"},{"rel":"Arts of Ancient Greece and Rome","href":"/events/programs/tours/arts-ancient-greece-rome?eid=R017_%7bF428DBBF-911D-47C3-BF37-47C3F3F2E51E%7d_20131008123000","date":"October 8, 2013"},{"rel":"Arts of Ancient Greece and Rome","href":"/events/programs/tours/arts-ancient-greece-rome?eid=R018_%7bF428DBBF-911D-47C3-BF37-47C3F3F2E51E%7d_20131010123000","date":"October 10, 2013"},{"rel":"Искуство Древней Греции и Рима (Arts of Ancient Greece and Rome in Russian)","href":"/events/programs/tours/arts-ancient-greece-rome-russian?eid=R005_%7b71655D2F-2D95-42B5-AC13-1F3BF3CB4904%7d_20131010130000","date":"October 10, 2013"},{"rel":"Arts of Ancient Greece and Rome","href":"/events/programs/tours/arts-ancient-greece-rome?eid=R019_%7bF428DBBF-911D-47C3-BF37-47C3F3F2E51E%7d_20131011123000","date":"October 11, 2013"},{"rel":"Friday Focus—Triumphs and Tribulations: The Growth of the Met's Etruscan Collection","href":"/events/programs/lectures-and-panels/free-lectures/triumphs-and-tribulations?eid=A001_%7b3CF62CFA-8E68-497B-B994-92779FAB332C%7d_20130719155517","date":"October 11, 2013"},{"rel":"Arts of Ancient Greece and Rome","href":"/events/programs/tours/arts-ancient-greece-rome?eid=R021_%7bF428DBBF-911D-47C3-BF37-47C3F3F2E51E%7d_20131015123000","date":"October 15, 2013"},{"rel":"The Eastern Mediterranean, 1000 B.C.–1 A.D.","href":"http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/ht/?period=04®ion=wae","date":""}],"self":{"href":"/object/242014"},"source":{"href":"http://www.metmuseum.org/Collections/search-the-collections/242014"}},"assigned_for_tagging":false,"tags":{"faces":[{"center_pos":{"value":[0.5075,0.182],"user":"tloong@gmail.com"}}]}}

The conical cap, identifying him as an individual of high rank, appears at the end of the eighth century B.C. in the Levant and had reached Cyprus by the mid-seventh century B.C. It is characterized by a protuberance at the top and flaps at the sides that could be let down or fastened up by the ties ending in tassels. While, unfortunately, nothing of the body remains, the head represents a very early and impressive example of this figural type. The articulation of the beard, with its round, generalized curls, is often interpreted as an indication of the influence of terracotta sculpture on stoneworking.","provenance":["Golgoi–Ayios Photios, “near the temple”"],"links":{"related-artworks":[{"href":"http://scrapi.org/object/242006"},{"href":"http://scrapi.org/object/242010"},{"href":"http://scrapi.org/object/242004"},{"href":"http://scrapi.org/object/242008"},{"href":"http://scrapi.org/object/242011"}],"related-content":[{"rel":"Arts of Ancient Greece and Rome","href":"/events/programs/tours/arts-ancient-greece-rome?eid=R021_%7bF428DBBF-911D-47C3-BF37-47C3F3F2E51E%7d_20131015123000","date":"October 15, 2013"},{"rel":"Arts of Ancient Greece and Rome","href":"/events/programs/tours/arts-ancient-greece-rome?eid=R022_%7bF428DBBF-911D-47C3-BF37-47C3F3F2E51E%7d_20131017123000","date":"October 17, 2013"},{"rel":"Искуство Древней Греции и Рима (Arts of Ancient Greece and Rome in Russian)","href":"/events/programs/tours/arts-ancient-greece-rome-russian?eid=R006_%7b71655D2F-2D95-42B5-AC13-1F3BF3CB4904%7d_20131017130000","date":"October 17, 2013"},{"rel":"Arts of Ancient Greece and Rome","href":"/events/programs/tours/arts-ancient-greece-rome?eid=R023_%7bF428DBBF-911D-47C3-BF37-47C3F3F2E51E%7d_20131018123000","date":"October 18, 2013"},{"rel":"Stone and Metal: Etruscan Art","href":"/events/programs/family-programs/sunday-studio/stone-and-metal?eid=A002_%7bC5DE7A07-5D55-4413-9233-A4C1E8A0E912%7d_20130722153906","date":"October 20, 2013"},{"rel":"Arts of Ancient Greece and Rome","href":"/events/programs/tours/arts-ancient-greece-rome?eid=A128_%7bF428DBBF-911D-47C3-BF37-47C3F3F2E51E%7d_20130812100717","date":"October 20, 2013"},{"rel":"Arts of Ancient Greece and Rome","href":"/events/programs/tours/arts-ancient-greece-rome?eid=R024_%7bF428DBBF-911D-47C3-BF37-47C3F3F2E51E%7d_20131021123000","date":"October 21, 2013"},{"rel":"Arts of Ancient Greece and Rome","href":"/events/programs/tours/arts-ancient-greece-rome?eid=R025_%7bF428DBBF-911D-47C3-BF37-47C3F3F2E51E%7d_20131022123000","date":"October 22, 2013"},{"rel":"Arts of Ancient Greece and Rome","href":"/events/programs/tours/arts-ancient-greece-rome?eid=R026_%7bF428DBBF-911D-47C3-BF37-47C3F3F2E51E%7d_20131024123000","date":"October 24, 2013"},{"rel":"Искуство Древней Греции и Рима (Arts of Ancient Greece and Rome in Russian)","href":"/events/programs/tours/arts-ancient-greece-rome-russian?eid=R007_%7b71655D2F-2D95-42B5-AC13-1F3BF3CB4904%7d_20131024130000","date":"October 24, 2013"},{"rel":"The Eastern Mediterranean, 1000 B.C.–1 A.D.","href":"http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/ht/?period=04®ion=wae","date":""}],"self":{"href":"http://scrapi.org/object/242408"},"source":{"href":"http://www.metmuseum.org/Collections/search-the-collections/242408"}},"assigned_for_tagging":false,"tags":{"faces":[{"center_pos":{"value":[0.515,0.6073752711496746],"user":"jonathan@jedahan.com"}}]}}

A continuous mold seam runs from the base of neck, down body, and across bottom.On underside of mouth, a single thick horizontal trail; janiform body comprising two similar youthful heads, each with his ears, back to back: short-cropped, curly hair, circular, rather stylized ears with pendant earrings (?), broad forehead, high arched eyebrows, almond-shaped eyes with indented pupils, chubby cheeks, open mouth showing teeth, and small prominent chin.Complete, except for large hole on nose of one head and small internal crack near base of neck; many bubbles, some elongated in neck, black impurities in handle, and blowing striations; dulling and iridescence on exterior, some soli encrustation and creamy white weathering on interior.A number of similar large flasks in the form of two heads are known from sites in northeastern France and the Rhineland. Most show the faces with long curly hair that covers the ears. Here, however, the maker gave the heads short hair, and so two pairs of ears are visible, making for a rather odd effect when seen from the side.","provenance":["Said to be from Saint-Mansuy near Tullum (modern Toul, France) (Froehner 1879, p. 60)Until 1881, collection of Jules Charvet, Le Pecq, Île-de-France","1881, purchased from J.

It is a reminder that many of the disembodied portrait heads displayed in these galleries were once attached to freestanding sculptures, whose original appearances were undoubtedly quite different. Portraits of the emperor served the highly important function in imperial propaganda of presenting the ruler to the public and of projecting the personality with which he wished to be perceived. Leadership and military strength are evoked in the heroic nudity of the figure and in the pose, which recalls the famous statue of Alexander the Great with the Lance by Lysippos. In contrast to the idealized body, the portrait head represents the emperor with brutish realism. Trebonianus likely would have cradled a parazonium, or short sword, in his left arm, and held a spear in his upraised right hand.      The statue has undergone several campaigns of restoration since its discovery in the early nineteenth century and was examined in great detail as part of the conservation treatment in preparation for its display here. Visual examination inside and out, combined with x-radiography, made possible the clear identification of ancient and restored areas, which are indicated in the accompanying illustration. At least three-quarters of the statue is ancient. Despite the discrepancy in scale, the head belongs to the body. Although the mantle draped over his left shoulder is a modern restoration, cast edges beneath it confirm that the statue had a similar embellishment in antiquity. The left foot with its elaborately decorated open-fronted boot appears to be ancient but may not belong.","provenance":["Said to be from near the church of San Giovanni, Laterano, Rome"],"links":{"related-artworks":[{"href":"http://scrapi.org/object/244457"},{"href":"http://scrapi.org/object/244459"},{"href":"http://scrapi.org/object/246291"},{"href":"http://scrapi.org/object/246299"},{"href":"http://scrapi.org/object/246311"}],"related-content":[{"rel":"Arts of Ancient Greece and Rome","href":"/events/programs/tours/arts-ancient-greece-rome?eid=R015_%7bF428DBBF-911D-47C3-BF37-47C3F3F2E51E%7d_20131004123000","date":"October 4, 2013"},{"rel":"Stone and Metal: Etruscan Art","href":"/events/programs/family-programs/sunday-studio/stone-and-metal?eid=A001_%7bC5DE7A07-5D55-4413-9233-A4C1E8A0E912%7d_20130722153815","date":"October 6, 2013"},{"rel":"Arts of Ancient Greece and Rome","href":"/events/programs/tours/arts-ancient-greece-rome?eid=A126_%7bF428DBBF-911D-47C3-BF37-47C3F3F2E51E%7d_20130812100612","date":"October 6, 2013"},{"rel":"Arts of Ancient Greece and Rome","href":"/events/programs/tours/arts-ancient-greece-rome?eid=R016_%7bF428DBBF-911D-47C3-BF37-47C3F3F2E51E%7d_20131007123000","date":"October 7, 2013"},{"rel":"Arts of Ancient Greece and Rome","href":"/events/programs/tours/arts-ancient-greece-rome?eid=R017_%7bF428DBBF-911D-47C3-BF37-47C3F3F2E51E%7d_20131008123000","date":"October 8, 2013"},{"rel":"Arts of Ancient Greece and Rome","href":"/events/programs/tours/arts-ancient-greece-rome?eid=R018_%7bF428DBBF-911D-47C3-BF37-47C3F3F2E51E%7d_20131010123000","date":"October 10, 2013"},{"rel":"Искуство Древней Греции и Рима (Arts of Ancient Greece and Rome in Russian)","href":"/events/programs/tours/arts-ancient-greece-rome-russian?eid=R005_%7b71655D2F-2D95-42B5-AC13-1F3BF3CB4904%7d_20131010130000","date":"October 10, 2013"},{"rel":"Arts of Ancient Greece and Rome","href":"/events/programs/tours/arts-ancient-greece-rome?eid=R019_%7bF428DBBF-911D-47C3-BF37-47C3F3F2E51E%7d_20131011123000","date":"October 11, 2013"},{"rel":"Friday Focus—Triumphs and Tribulations: The Growth of the Met's Etruscan Collection","href":"/events/programs/lectures-and-panels/free-lectures/triumphs-and-tribulations?eid=A001_%7b3CF62CFA-8E68-497B-B994-92779FAB332C%7d_20130719155517","date":"October 11, 2013"},{"rel":"Arts of Ancient Greece and Rome","href":"/events/programs/tours/arts-ancient-greece-rome?eid=R021_%7bF428DBBF-911D-47C3-BF37-47C3F3F2E51E%7d_20131015123000","date":"October 15, 2013"},{"rel":"Italian Peninsula, 1–500A.D.","href":"http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/ht/?period=05®ion=eust","date":""}],"self":{"href":"/object/247117"},"source":{"href":"http://www.metmuseum.org/Collections/search-the-collections/247117"}},"assigned_for_tagging":false,"tags":{"faces":[{"center_pos":{"value":[0.5225,0.24390243902439024],"user":"adam.vigiano@gmail.com"}}]}}

There he founded a city called Lavinium (modern Pratica di Mare), a site eighteen miles south of Rome, which became a major religious center for the Latin people. The distinctive clothing and jewelry on this life-sized statue closely resemble those on fourth and third century B.C. terracottas found there. The elaborate necklaces and armband appear to be reproduced from molds of actual jewelry. Some of the pendants are decorated with reliefs depicting various Etruscan deities and heroes. Originally, this woman wore a pair of grape-cluster earrings. The one on her left ear is visible behind her long hair. When complete, the statue probably stood in a sanctuary and showed the young woman holding an incense box in her extended right hand. This rare statue is an exceptional example of the awakening sophistication of Italic artists, who over the following two centuries fused native traditions with imported ones and gave birth to the multifaceted art of Late Republican Rome.","links":{"related-artworks":[{"href":"http://scrapi.org/object/246190"},{"href":"http://scrapi.org/object/246191"},{"href":"http://scrapi.org/object/246666"},{"href":"http://scrapi.org/object/246667"},{"href":"http://scrapi.org/object/248595"}],"related-content":[{"rel":"Arts of Ancient Greece and Rome","href":"/events/programs/tours/arts-ancient-greece-rome?eid=R021_%7bF428DBBF-911D-47C3-BF37-47C3F3F2E51E%7d_20131015123000","date":"October 15, 2013"},{"rel":"Arts of Ancient Greece and Rome","href":"/events/programs/tours/arts-ancient-greece-rome?eid=R022_%7bF428DBBF-911D-47C3-BF37-47C3F3F2E51E%7d_20131017123000","date":"October 17, 2013"},{"rel":"Искуство Древней Греции и Рима (Arts of Ancient Greece and Rome in Russian)","href":"/events/programs/tours/arts-ancient-greece-rome-russian?eid=R006_%7b71655D2F-2D95-42B5-AC13-1F3BF3CB4904%7d_20131017130000","date":"October 17, 2013"},{"rel":"Arts of Ancient Greece and Rome","href":"/events/programs/tours/arts-ancient-greece-rome?eid=R023_%7bF428DBBF-911D-47C3-BF37-47C3F3F2E51E%7d_20131018123000","date":"October 18, 2013"},{"rel":"Stone and Metal: Etruscan Art","href":"/events/programs/family-programs/sunday-studio/stone-and-metal?eid=A002_%7bC5DE7A07-5D55-4413-9233-A4C1E8A0E912%7d_20130722153906","date":"October 20, 2013"},{"rel":"Arts of Ancient Greece and Rome","href":"/events/programs/tours/arts-ancient-greece-rome?eid=A128_%7bF428DBBF-911D-47C3-BF37-47C3F3F2E51E%7d_20130812100717","date":"October 20, 2013"},{"rel":"Arts of Ancient Greece and Rome","href":"/events/programs/tours/arts-ancient-greece-rome?eid=R024_%7bF428DBBF-911D-47C3-BF37-47C3F3F2E51E%7d_20131021123000","date":"October 21, 2013"},{"rel":"Arts of Ancient Greece and Rome","href":"/events/programs/tours/arts-ancient-greece-rome?eid=R025_%7bF428DBBF-911D-47C3-BF37-47C3F3F2E51E%7d_20131022123000","date":"October 22, 2013"},{"rel":"Arts of Ancient Greece and Rome","href":"/events/programs/tours/arts-ancient-greece-rome?eid=R026_%7bF428DBBF-911D-47C3-BF37-47C3F3F2E51E%7d_20131024123000","date":"October 24, 2013"},{"rel":"Искуство Древней Греции и Рима (Arts of Ancient Greece and Rome in Russian)","href":"/events/programs/tours/arts-ancient-greece-rome-russian?eid=R007_%7b71655D2F-2D95-42B5-AC13-1F3BF3CB4904%7d_20131024130000","date":"October 24, 2013"},{"rel":"Italian Peninsula, 1000 B.C.–1 A.D.","href":"http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/ht/?period=04®ion=eust","date":""}],"self":{"href":"http://scrapi.org/object/249091"},"source":{"href":"http://www.metmuseum.org/Collections/search-the-collections/249091"}},"assigned_for_tagging":false,"tags":{"faces":[{"center_pos":{"value":[0.485,0.3048327137546468],"user":"anamarva@gmail.com"}}]}}

Preserved at its base are holes containing traces of an iron pin, indicating that the original object was a fibula. The representation shows a woman and man reclining on a couch. The woman wears a pointed hat, long cloak, and pointed shoes. In her right hand, she holds the base of a small vase, and the fingers of her left touch the mouth of the vase. Her companion is a young, beardless man with a round face. The back view shows his long hair, the modulated folds of his overgarment, and his shoes on the ground. A bird nestles at the shoulders of the couple, and a small attendant stands at their feet.The Morgan Amber was reputedly found at Falconara in Picene territory. The iconography of the reclining couple and ceremonial banquet spread westward from the Ancient Near East through Greece. While numerous details are Etruscan, it is impossible to identify where the artist came from and whether the figures are mortal or divine.","links":{"related-artworks":[{"href":"http://scrapi.org/object/250585"},{"href":"http://scrapi.org/object/256085"},{"href":"http://scrapi.org/object/245861"},{"href":"http://scrapi.org/object/246105"},{"href":"http://scrapi.org/object/246328"}],"related-content":[{"rel":"Arts of Ancient Greece and Rome","href":"/events/programs/tours/arts-ancient-greece-rome?eid=R015_%7bF428DBBF-911D-47C3-BF37-47C3F3F2E51E%7d_20131004123000","date":"October 4, 2013"},{"rel":"Stone and Metal: Etruscan Art","href":"/events/programs/family-programs/sunday-studio/stone-and-metal?eid=A001_%7bC5DE7A07-5D55-4413-9233-A4C1E8A0E912%7d_20130722153815","date":"October 6, 2013"},{"rel":"Arts of Ancient Greece and Rome","href":"/events/programs/tours/arts-ancient-greece-rome?eid=A126_%7bF428DBBF-911D-47C3-BF37-47C3F3F2E51E%7d_20130812100612","date":"October 6, 2013"},{"rel":"Arts of Ancient Greece and Rome","href":"/events/programs/tours/arts-ancient-greece-rome?eid=R016_%7bF428DBBF-911D-47C3-BF37-47C3F3F2E51E%7d_20131007123000","date":"October 7, 2013"},{"rel":"Arts of Ancient Greece and Rome","href":"/events/programs/tours/arts-ancient-greece-rome?eid=R017_%7bF428DBBF-911D-47C3-BF37-47C3F3F2E51E%7d_20131008123000","date":"October 8, 2013"},{"rel":"Arts of Ancient Greece and Rome","href":"/events/programs/tours/arts-ancient-greece-rome?eid=R018_%7bF428DBBF-911D-47C3-BF37-47C3F3F2E51E%7d_20131010123000","date":"October 10, 2013"},{"rel":"Искуство Древней Греции и Рима (Arts of Ancient Greece and Rome in Russian)","href":"/events/programs/tours/arts-ancient-greece-rome-russian?eid=R005_%7b71655D2F-2D95-42B5-AC13-1F3BF3CB4904%7d_20131010130000","date":"October 10, 2013"},{"rel":"Arts of Ancient Greece and Rome","href":"/events/programs/tours/arts-ancient-greece-rome?eid=R019_%7bF428DBBF-911D-47C3-BF37-47C3F3F2E51E%7d_20131011123000","date":"October 11, 2013"},{"rel":"Friday Focus—Triumphs and Tribulations: The Growth of the Met's Etruscan Collection","href":"/events/programs/lectures-and-panels/free-lectures/triumphs-and-tribulations?eid=A001_%7b3CF62CFA-8E68-497B-B994-92779FAB332C%7d_20130719155517","date":"October 11, 2013"},{"rel":"Arts of Ancient Greece and Rome","href":"/events/programs/tours/arts-ancient-greece-rome?eid=R021_%7bF428DBBF-911D-47C3-BF37-47C3F3F2E51E%7d_20131015123000","date":"October 15, 2013"},{"rel":"Italian Peninsula, 1000 B.C.–1 A.D.","href":"http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/ht/?period=04®ion=eust","date":""}],"self":{"href":"/object/249223"},"source":{"href":"http://www.metmuseum.org/Collections/search-the-collections/249223"}},"assigned_for_tagging":false,"tags":{"faces":[{"center_pos":{"value":[0.83,0.445],"user":"aisencc@gmail.com"}},{"center_pos":{"value":[0.7475,0.4125],"user":"aisencc@gmail.com"}}]}}

The outcome of the conflict is indicated by the end of the spear preserved in the centaur's left flank and by the greater height of the man.","provenance":["Said to be from Olympia (Mertens 1985, p. 19).From 1906, collection of J.

The style of this female head, with its almond-shaped eyes, Archaic smile, and wig-like hair arrangement is strongly reminiscent of Greek, especially Ionian examples.

Remainder of the figure is a cast taken from a marble copy found at Delos and now in the Nation Museum, Athens.Copy of a Greek bronze statue of ca. 430 B.C. by PolykleitosThe statue represents a youth adorning his head with a fillet (band) after a victory in an athletic contest. The original bronze probably stood in a sanctuary such as that at Olympia or Delphi where games were regularly held. The Greek sculptor Polykleitos of Argos, who worked during the mid-fifth century B.C., was one of the most famous artists of the ancient world. His figures are carefully designed with special attention to bodily proportions and stance. The figure's thorax and pelvis tilt in opposite directions, setting up rhythmic contrasts in the torso that create an impression of organic vitality. The position of the feet—poised between standing and walking—give a sense of potential movement. This rigorously calculated pose, which is found in almost all work attributed to Polykleitos, became a standard formula used in Graeco-Roman and later Western European art.","links":{"related-artworks":[{"href":"http://scrapi.org/object/246991"},{"href":"http://scrapi.org/object/247994"},{"href":"http://scrapi.org/object/254925"}],"related-content":[{"rel":"Arts of Ancient Greece and Rome","href":"/events/programs/tours/arts-ancient-greece-rome?eid=R021_%7bF428DBBF-911D-47C3-BF37-47C3F3F2E51E%7d_20131015123000","date":"October 15, 2013"},{"rel":"Arts of Ancient Greece and Rome","href":"/events/programs/tours/arts-ancient-greece-rome?eid=R022_%7bF428DBBF-911D-47C3-BF37-47C3F3F2E51E%7d_20131017123000","date":"October 17, 2013"},{"rel":"Искуство Древней Греции и Рима (Arts of Ancient Greece and Rome in Russian)","href":"/events/programs/tours/arts-ancient-greece-rome-russian?eid=R006_%7b71655D2F-2D95-42B5-AC13-1F3BF3CB4904%7d_20131017130000","date":"October 17, 2013"},{"rel":"Arts of Ancient Greece and Rome","href":"/events/programs/tours/arts-ancient-greece-rome?eid=R023_%7bF428DBBF-911D-47C3-BF37-47C3F3F2E51E%7d_20131018123000","date":"October 18, 2013"},{"rel":"Stone and Metal: Etruscan Art","href":"/events/programs/family-programs/sunday-studio/stone-and-metal?eid=A002_%7bC5DE7A07-5D55-4413-9233-A4C1E8A0E912%7d_20130722153906","date":"October 20, 2013"},{"rel":"Arts of Ancient Greece and Rome","href":"/events/programs/tours/arts-ancient-greece-rome?eid=A128_%7bF428DBBF-911D-47C3-BF37-47C3F3F2E51E%7d_20130812100717","date":"October 20, 2013"},{"rel":"Arts of Ancient Greece and Rome","href":"/events/programs/tours/arts-ancient-greece-rome?eid=R024_%7bF428DBBF-911D-47C3-BF37-47C3F3F2E51E%7d_20131021123000","date":"October 21, 2013"},{"rel":"Arts of Ancient Greece and Rome","href":"/events/programs/tours/arts-ancient-greece-rome?eid=R025_%7bF428DBBF-911D-47C3-BF37-47C3F3F2E51E%7d_20131022123000","date":"October 22, 2013"},{"rel":"Arts of Ancient Greece and Rome","href":"/events/programs/tours/arts-ancient-greece-rome?eid=R026_%7bF428DBBF-911D-47C3-BF37-47C3F3F2E51E%7d_20131024123000","date":"October 24, 2013"},{"rel":"Искуство Древней Греции и Рима (Arts of Ancient Greece and Rome in Russian)","href":"/events/programs/tours/arts-ancient-greece-rome-russian?eid=R007_%7b71655D2F-2D95-42B5-AC13-1F3BF3CB4904%7d_20131024130000","date":"October 24, 2013"},{"rel":"Athletics in Ancient Greece","href":"http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/athl/hd_athl.htm","date":""},{"rel":"Roman Copies of Greek Statues","href":"http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/rogr/hd_rogr.htm","date":""},{"rel":"The Rediscovery of Classical Antiquity","href":"http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/clan/hd_clan.htm","date":""},{"rel":"Italian Peninsula, 1–500A.D.","href":"http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/ht/?period=05®ion=eust","date":""}],"self":{"href":"http://scrapi.org/object/251838"},"source":{"href":"http://www.metmuseum.org/Collections/search-the-collections/251838"}},"assigned_for_tagging":false,"tags":{"faces":[{"center_pos":{"value":[0.455,0.18566176470588236],"user":"anamarva@gmail.com"}}]}}

The Persians removed the statues during their sack of Athens in 480 B.C., and two new ones were erected in 477/476 B.C. For one hundred years these heroized figures were the only statues of Athenian citizens allowed in the agora and, throughout antiquity, they remained among the most famous statues in Greece. The young Harmodios was represented raising his sword over his head, ready to deliver a slashing downward stroke. The remnants of two struts that supported the right forearm are visible on the front and side of this Roman copy.","links":{"related-artworks":[{"href":"http://scrapi.org/object/239584"},{"href":"http://scrapi.org/object/245585"},{"href":"http://scrapi.org/object/245829"},{"href":"http://scrapi.org/object/246266"},{"href":"http://scrapi.org/object/246986"}],"related-content":[{"rel":"Arts of Ancient Greece and Rome","href":"/events/programs/tours/arts-ancient-greece-rome?eid=R021_%7bF428DBBF-911D-47C3-BF37-47C3F3F2E51E%7d_20131015123000","date":"October 15, 2013"},{"rel":"Arts of Ancient Greece and Rome","href":"/events/programs/tours/arts-ancient-greece-rome?eid=R022_%7bF428DBBF-911D-47C3-BF37-47C3F3F2E51E%7d_20131017123000","date":"October 17, 2013"},{"rel":"Искуство Древней Греции и Рима (Arts of Ancient Greece and Rome in Russian)","href":"/events/programs/tours/arts-ancient-greece-rome-russian?eid=R006_%7b71655D2F-2D95-42B5-AC13-1F3BF3CB4904%7d_20131017130000","date":"October 17, 2013"},{"rel":"Arts of Ancient Greece and Rome","href":"/events/programs/tours/arts-ancient-greece-rome?eid=R023_%7bF428DBBF-911D-47C3-BF37-47C3F3F2E51E%7d_20131018123000","date":"October 18, 2013"},{"rel":"Stone and Metal: Etruscan Art","href":"/events/programs/family-programs/sunday-studio/stone-and-metal?eid=A002_%7bC5DE7A07-5D55-4413-9233-A4C1E8A0E912%7d_20130722153906","date":"October 20, 2013"},{"rel":"Arts of Ancient Greece and Rome","href":"/events/programs/tours/arts-ancient-greece-rome?eid=A128_%7bF428DBBF-911D-47C3-BF37-47C3F3F2E51E%7d_20130812100717","date":"October 20, 2013"},{"rel":"Arts of Ancient Greece and Rome","href":"/events/programs/tours/arts-ancient-greece-rome?eid=R024_%7bF428DBBF-911D-47C3-BF37-47C3F3F2E51E%7d_20131021123000","date":"October 21, 2013"},{"rel":"Arts of Ancient Greece and Rome","href":"/events/programs/tours/arts-ancient-greece-rome?eid=R025_%7bF428DBBF-911D-47C3-BF37-47C3F3F2E51E%7d_20131022123000","date":"October 22, 2013"},{"rel":"Arts of Ancient Greece and Rome","href":"/events/programs/tours/arts-ancient-greece-rome?eid=R026_%7bF428DBBF-911D-47C3-BF37-47C3F3F2E51E%7d_20131024123000","date":"October 24, 2013"},{"rel":"Искуство Древней Греции и Рима (Arts of Ancient Greece and Rome in Russian)","href":"/events/programs/tours/arts-ancient-greece-rome-russian?eid=R007_%7b71655D2F-2D95-42B5-AC13-1F3BF3CB4904%7d_20131024130000","date":"October 24, 2013"},{"rel":"Roman Copies of Greek Statues","href":"http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/rogr/hd_rogr.htm","date":""},{"rel":"The Art of Classical Greece (ca. 480–323 B.C.)","href":"http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/tacg/hd_tacg.htm","date":""},{"rel":"Italian Peninsula, 1–500A.D.","href":"http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/ht/?period=05®ion=eust","date":""}],"self":{"href":"http://scrapi.org/object/252468"},"source":{"href":"http://www.metmuseum.org/Collections/search-the-collections/252468"}},"assigned_for_tagging":false,"tags":{"faces":[{"center_pos":{"value":[0.485,0.6375],"user":"dawn barber"}}]}}

This statuette was found in Egypt together with an identical figure that is now in the collection of the Walters Art Gallery, Baltimore.  The subject's identity has been much debated and remains a mystery.  He may represent Attis, a god of vegetation from Phrygia in central Anatolia.  It has also been suggested that the existence of two copies of the same statuette may reflect a double geographical reference—that is, if set up together, the twin figures could be identified as the personifications of Armenia Major and Armenia Minor.  However, the images are so similar that more likely they represent the same individual. Most recently, the statuette has been identified as a portrait of Alexander Helios, son of Mark Antony and Cleopatra VII, as prince of Armenia after Mark Antony's conquest in 34 B.C.  On the other hand, the mannered style, exotic dress, and moderate scale of this figure likely signal a decorative function for the statuette, possibly as a lamp or incense-burner stand.","provenance":["Said to have been found east of the Suez Canal or in Alexandria in 1912 (Smith 1917, p. 135)1912, said to have been found east of Suez Canal or in Alexandria","[in 1920s, with the Durlacher Brothers, New York or London]","by 1944, with the Spanish Art Gallery, London","[until June 1949, with Joseph Brummer, New York]","acquired in June 1949, purchased through the Parke-Bernet Galleries, Inc., New York."],"links":{"related-artworks":[{"href":"http://scrapi.org/object/244458"},{"href":"http://scrapi.org/object/248466"},{"href":"http://scrapi.org/object/248788"},{"href":"http://scrapi.org/object/256655"},{"href":"http://scrapi.org/object/256658"}],"related-content":[{"rel":"Arts of Ancient Greece and Rome","href":"/events/programs/tours/arts-ancient-greece-rome?eid=R021_%7bF428DBBF-911D-47C3-BF37-47C3F3F2E51E%7d_20131015123000","date":"October 15, 2013"},{"rel":"Arts of Ancient Greece and Rome","href":"/events/programs/tours/arts-ancient-greece-rome?eid=R022_%7bF428DBBF-911D-47C3-BF37-47C3F3F2E51E%7d_20131017123000","date":"October 17, 2013"},{"rel":"Искуство Древней Греции и Рима (Arts of Ancient Greece and Rome in Russian)","href":"/events/programs/tours/arts-ancient-greece-rome-russian?eid=R006_%7b71655D2F-2D95-42B5-AC13-1F3BF3CB4904%7d_20131017130000","date":"October 17, 2013"},{"rel":"Arts of Ancient Greece and Rome","href":"/events/programs/tours/arts-ancient-greece-rome?eid=R023_%7bF428DBBF-911D-47C3-BF37-47C3F3F2E51E%7d_20131018123000","date":"October 18, 2013"},{"rel":"Stone and Metal: Etruscan Art","href":"/events/programs/family-programs/sunday-studio/stone-and-metal?eid=A002_%7bC5DE7A07-5D55-4413-9233-A4C1E8A0E912%7d_20130722153906","date":"October 20, 2013"},{"rel":"Arts of Ancient Greece and Rome","href":"/events/programs/tours/arts-ancient-greece-rome?eid=A128_%7bF428DBBF-911D-47C3-BF37-47C3F3F2E51E%7d_20130812100717","date":"October 20, 2013"},{"rel":"Arts of Ancient Greece and Rome","href":"/events/programs/tours/arts-ancient-greece-rome?eid=R024_%7bF428DBBF-911D-47C3-BF37-47C3F3F2E51E%7d_20131021123000","date":"October 21, 2013"},{"rel":"Arts of Ancient Greece and Rome","href":"/events/programs/tours/arts-ancient-greece-rome?eid=R025_%7bF428DBBF-911D-47C3-BF37-47C3F3F2E51E%7d_20131022123000","date":"October 22, 2013"},{"rel":"Arts of Ancient Greece and Rome","href":"/events/programs/tours/arts-ancient-greece-rome?eid=R026_%7bF428DBBF-911D-47C3-BF37-47C3F3F2E51E%7d_20131024123000","date":"October 24, 2013"},{"rel":"Искуство Древней Греции и Рима (Arts of Ancient Greece and Rome in Russian)","href":"/events/programs/tours/arts-ancient-greece-rome-russian?eid=R007_%7b71655D2F-2D95-42B5-AC13-1F3BF3CB4904%7d_20131024130000","date":"October 24, 2013"},{"rel":"Italian Peninsula, 1000 B.C.–1 A.D.","href":"http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/ht/?period=04®ion=eust","date":""}],"self":{"href":"http://scrapi.org/object/254613"},"source":{"href":"http://www.metmuseum.org/Collections/search-the-collections/254613"}},"assigned_for_tagging":false,"tags":{"faces":[{"center_pos":{"value":[0.505,0.2625250501002004],"user":"Francisco"}}]}}

An inscription on the unfinished back of the sarcophagus records that it was installed there in 1733. In contrast to the rough and unsightly back, the sides and front of the sarcophagus are decorated with forty human and animal figures carved in high relief. The central figure is that of the god Dionysos seated on a panther, but he is somewhat overshadowed by four larger standing figures who represent the four Seasons (from left to right, Winter, Spring, Summer, and Fall). The figures are unusual in that the Seasons are usually portrayed as women, but here they are shown as sturdy youths. Around these five central figures are placed other Bacchic figures and cultic objects, all carved at a smaller scale. On the rounded ends of the sarcophagus are two other groups of large figures, similarly intermingled with lesser ones. On the left end, Mother Earth is portrayed reclining on the ground; she is accompanied by a satyr and a youth carrying fruit. On the right end, a bearded male figure, probably to be identified with the personification of a river-god, reclines in front of two winged youths, perhaps representing two additional Seasons. The sarcophagus is an exquisite example of Roman funerary art, displaying all the virtuosity of the workshop where it was carved. The marble comes from a quarry in the eastern Mediterranean and was probably shipped to Rome, where it was worked. Only a very wealthy and powerful person would have been able to commission and purchase such a sarcophagus, and it was probably made for a member of one of the old aristocratic families in Rome itself. The subjects - the triumph of Dionysos and the Seasons - are unlikely, however, to have had any special significance for the deceased, particularly as it is clear that the design was copied from a sculptor's pattern book. Another sarcophagus, now in the Hessisches Landesmuseum in Kassel, Germany, has the same composition of Dionysos flanked by the four Seasons, although the treatment and carving of the figures is quite different. On the Badminton sarcophagus the figures are carved in high relief and so endow the crowded scene with multiple areas of light and shade, allowing the eye to wander effortlessly from one figure to another. One must also imagine that certain details were highlighted with color and even gilding, making the whole composition a visual tour de force.Very few Roman sarcophagi of this quality have survived. Although the Badminton sarcophagus lacks its lid, the fact that it was found in the early eighteenth century and soon thereafter installed in Badminton Hall means that it has been preserved almost intact and only a few of the minor extremities are now missing.","provenance":["Presumably found in Rome (McCann 1978, p. 94).Purchased by the Third Duke of Beaufort from Cardinal Giulio Alberoni (1664-1752) in Rome, the first recorded owner of the sarcophagus","1727-28, brought to England from Italy and by 1733, installed in Badminton House","from around 1727, collection of the Dukes of Beaufort","acquired June 10, 1955, purchased from His Grace the Duke of Beaufort, Badminton House, Gloucestershire, England."],"links":{"related-artworks":[{"href":"http://scrapi.org/object/239584"},{"href":"http://scrapi.org/object/245585"},{"href":"http://scrapi.org/object/248205"},{"href":"http://scrapi.org/object/249061"},{"href":"http://scrapi.org/object/249160"}],"related-content":[{"rel":"Arts of Ancient Greece and Rome","href":"/events/programs/tours/arts-ancient-greece-rome?eid=R015_%7bF428DBBF-911D-47C3-BF37-47C3F3F2E51E%7d_20131004123000","date":"October 4, 2013"},{"rel":"Stone and Metal: Etruscan Art","href":"/events/programs/family-programs/sunday-studio/stone-and-metal?eid=A001_%7bC5DE7A07-5D55-4413-9233-A4C1E8A0E912%7d_20130722153815","date":"October 6, 2013"},{"rel":"Arts of Ancient Greece and Rome","href":"/events/programs/tours/arts-ancient-greece-rome?eid=A126_%7bF428DBBF-911D-47C3-BF37-47C3F3F2E51E%7d_20130812100612","date":"October 6, 2013"},{"rel":"Arts of Ancient Greece and Rome","href":"/events/programs/tours/arts-ancient-greece-rome?eid=R016_%7bF428DBBF-911D-47C3-BF37-47C3F3F2E51E%7d_20131007123000","date":"October 7, 2013"},{"rel":"Arts of Ancient Greece and Rome","href":"/events/programs/tours/arts-ancient-greece-rome?eid=R017_%7bF428DBBF-911D-47C3-BF37-47C3F3F2E51E%7d_20131008123000","date":"October 8, 2013"},{"rel":"Arts of Ancient Greece and Rome","href":"/events/programs/tours/arts-ancient-greece-rome?eid=R018_%7bF428DBBF-911D-47C3-BF37-47C3F3F2E51E%7d_20131010123000","date":"October 10, 2013"},{"rel":"Искуство Древней Греции и Рима (Arts of Ancient Greece and Rome in Russian)","href":"/events/programs/tours/arts-ancient-greece-rome-russian?eid=R005_%7b71655D2F-2D95-42B5-AC13-1F3BF3CB4904%7d_20131010130000","date":"October 10, 2013"},{"rel":"Arts of Ancient Greece and Rome","href":"/events/programs/tours/arts-ancient-greece-rome?eid=R019_%7bF428DBBF-911D-47C3-BF37-47C3F3F2E51E%7d_20131011123000","date":"October 11, 2013"},{"rel":"Friday Focus—Triumphs and Tribulations: The Growth of the Met's Etruscan Collection","href":"/events/programs/lectures-and-panels/free-lectures/triumphs-and-tribulations?eid=A001_%7b3CF62CFA-8E68-497B-B994-92779FAB332C%7d_20130719155517","date":"October 11, 2013"},{"rel":"Arts of Ancient Greece and Rome","href":"/events/programs/tours/arts-ancient-greece-rome?eid=R021_%7bF428DBBF-911D-47C3-BF37-47C3F3F2E51E%7d_20131015123000","date":"October 15, 2013"},{"rel":"The Grand Tour","href":"http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/grtr/hd_grtr.htm","date":""},{"rel":"Italian Peninsula, 1–500A.D.","href":"http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/ht/?period=05®ion=eust","date":""}],"self":{"href":"/object/254819"},"source":{"href":"http://www.metmuseum.org/Collections/search-the-collections/254819"}},"assigned_for_tagging":false,"tags":{"faces":[{"center_pos":{"value":[0.1275,0.38493723849372385],"user":"Francisco"}}]}}

Cast-bronze griffins' heads often decorated the cauldron rims; they projected outward from the shoulder of the vessel on long necks made of hammered or cast bronze.  Some of the dedicated cauldrons were colossal. The Greek historian Herodotus describes one made for King Kroisos of Lydia that could hold 2,700 gallons and another dedicated on the island of Samos that was supported by huge kneeling figures. Over six hundred bronze griffins' heads from cauldrons are known today; most have been found at the sanctuary of Zeus at Olympia or at that of Hera on Samos.

Herms, the rectangular pillars surmounted by a head of Hermes, are first attested during the last quarter of the sixth century B.C.  They were used primarily as boundary markers and guardians of entrances and thoroughfares.  In the fifth century B.C., other deities such as Zeus were also represented in herm form and the monuments were used for a wider variety of functions.  It is not possible to identify the god represented here.  The elaborate hairstyle consisting of two long braids coiled around the head and held in place by a flat band is often found on images of Zeus or Poseidon.  The heavily lidded eyes and the dignified composure of the face point to the end of the early Classical period.","links":{"related-artworks":[{"href":"http://scrapi.org/object/245539"},{"href":"http://scrapi.org/object/247004"},{"href":"http://scrapi.org/object/247172"},{"href":"http://scrapi.org/object/247989"},{"href":"http://scrapi.org/object/247985"}],"related-content":[{"rel":"Arts of Ancient Greece and Rome","href":"/events/programs/tours/arts-ancient-greece-rome?eid=R015_%7bF428DBBF-911D-47C3-BF37-47C3F3F2E51E%7d_20131004123000","date":"October 4, 2013"},{"rel":"Stone and Metal: Etruscan Art","href":"/events/programs/family-programs/sunday-studio/stone-and-metal?eid=A001_%7bC5DE7A07-5D55-4413-9233-A4C1E8A0E912%7d_20130722153815","date":"October 6, 2013"},{"rel":"Arts of Ancient Greece and Rome","href":"/events/programs/tours/arts-ancient-greece-rome?eid=A126_%7bF428DBBF-911D-47C3-BF37-47C3F3F2E51E%7d_20130812100612","date":"October 6, 2013"},{"rel":"Arts of Ancient Greece and Rome","href":"/events/programs/tours/arts-ancient-greece-rome?eid=R016_%7bF428DBBF-911D-47C3-BF37-47C3F3F2E51E%7d_20131007123000","date":"October 7, 2013"},{"rel":"Arts of Ancient Greece and Rome","href":"/events/programs/tours/arts-ancient-greece-rome?eid=R017_%7bF428DBBF-911D-47C3-BF37-47C3F3F2E51E%7d_20131008123000","date":"October 8, 2013"},{"rel":"Arts of Ancient Greece and Rome","href":"/events/programs/tours/arts-ancient-greece-rome?eid=R018_%7bF428DBBF-911D-47C3-BF37-47C3F3F2E51E%7d_20131010123000","date":"October 10, 2013"},{"rel":"Искуство Древней Греции и Рима (Arts of Ancient Greece and Rome in Russian)","href":"/events/programs/tours/arts-ancient-greece-rome-russian?eid=R005_%7b71655D2F-2D95-42B5-AC13-1F3BF3CB4904%7d_20131010130000","date":"October 10, 2013"},{"rel":"Arts of Ancient Greece and Rome","href":"/events/programs/tours/arts-ancient-greece-rome?eid=R019_%7bF428DBBF-911D-47C3-BF37-47C3F3F2E51E%7d_20131011123000","date":"October 11, 2013"},{"rel":"Friday Focus—Triumphs and Tribulations: The Growth of the Met's Etruscan Collection","href":"/events/programs/lectures-and-panels/free-lectures/triumphs-and-tribulations?eid=A001_%7b3CF62CFA-8E68-497B-B994-92779FAB332C%7d_20130719155517","date":"October 11, 2013"},{"rel":"Arts of Ancient Greece and Rome","href":"/events/programs/tours/arts-ancient-greece-rome?eid=R021_%7bF428DBBF-911D-47C3-BF37-47C3F3F2E51E%7d_20131015123000","date":"October 15, 2013"},{"rel":"Ancient Greece, 1000 B.C.–1 A.D.","href":"http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/ht/?period=04®ion=eusb","date":""}],"self":{"href":"/object/256121"},"source":{"href":"http://www.metmuseum.org/Collections/search-the-collections/256121"}},"assigned_for_tagging":false,"tags":{"faces":[{"center_pos":{"value":[0.495,0.7137014314928425],"user":"adam.vigiano@gmail.com"}}]}}

In accordance with Egyptian custom, the distraught emperor initiated a cult venerating the dead youth, for the Egyptians believed that those who met such a death became assimilated to Osiris, god of the Underworld. Outside Egypt, numerous statues of Antinoos were erected that represented him as a beautiful youth, often in the guise of Dionysos, a Greek god closely related to Osiris. This head is a good example of the sophisticated portrait type created by imperial sculptors to incorporate what must have been actual features of the boy in an idealized image that conveys a god-like beauty. The ovoid face with a straight brow, almond-shaped eyes, smooth cheeks, and fleshy lips is surrounded by abundant tousled curls.

Like numerous portraits of the mid-second century A.D., this work shares many features with the type of portrait used to represent philosophers throughout antiquity. It is unlikely, however, that the man shown here followed that profession. The bust was designed to be seen strictly from the front. The top and back of the head, the rear of the neck, and the reverse of the breast areonly roughly blocked out. Since the back of the bust has not been hollowed out to provide for a supporting pillar and base, it is likely that the portrait was inserted into a marble tondo and displayed rather high on a wall.","links":{"related-artworks":[{"href":"http://scrapi.org/object/245829"},{"href":"http://scrapi.org/object/246984"},{"href":"http://scrapi.org/object/248142"},{"href":"http://scrapi.org/object/248467"},{"href":"http://scrapi.org/object/248722"}],"related-content":[{"rel":"Arts of Ancient Greece and Rome","href":"/events/programs/tours/arts-ancient-greece-rome?eid=R015_%7bF428DBBF-911D-47C3-BF37-47C3F3F2E51E%7d_20131004123000","date":"October 4, 2013"},{"rel":"Stone and Metal: Etruscan Art","href":"/events/programs/family-programs/sunday-studio/stone-and-metal?eid=A001_%7bC5DE7A07-5D55-4413-9233-A4C1E8A0E912%7d_20130722153815","date":"October 6, 2013"},{"rel":"Arts of Ancient Greece and Rome","href":"/events/programs/tours/arts-ancient-greece-rome?eid=A126_%7bF428DBBF-911D-47C3-BF37-47C3F3F2E51E%7d_20130812100612","date":"October 6, 2013"},{"rel":"Arts of Ancient Greece and Rome","href":"/events/programs/tours/arts-ancient-greece-rome?eid=R016_%7bF428DBBF-911D-47C3-BF37-47C3F3F2E51E%7d_20131007123000","date":"October 7, 2013"},{"rel":"Arts of Ancient Greece and Rome","href":"/events/programs/tours/arts-ancient-greece-rome?eid=R017_%7bF428DBBF-911D-47C3-BF37-47C3F3F2E51E%7d_20131008123000","date":"October 8, 2013"},{"rel":"Arts of Ancient Greece and Rome","href":"/events/programs/tours/arts-ancient-greece-rome?eid=R018_%7bF428DBBF-911D-47C3-BF37-47C3F3F2E51E%7d_20131010123000","date":"October 10, 2013"},{"rel":"Искуство Древней Греции и Рима (Arts of Ancient Greece and Rome in Russian)","href":"/events/programs/tours/arts-ancient-greece-rome-russian?eid=R005_%7b71655D2F-2D95-42B5-AC13-1F3BF3CB4904%7d_20131010130000","date":"October 10, 2013"},{"rel":"Arts of Ancient Greece and Rome","href":"/events/programs/tours/arts-ancient-greece-rome?eid=R019_%7bF428DBBF-911D-47C3-BF37-47C3F3F2E51E%7d_20131011123000","date":"October 11, 2013"},{"rel":"Friday Focus—Triumphs and Tribulations: The Growth of the Met's Etruscan Collection","href":"/events/programs/lectures-and-panels/free-lectures/triumphs-and-tribulations?eid=A001_%7b3CF62CFA-8E68-497B-B994-92779FAB332C%7d_20130719155517","date":"October 11, 2013"},{"rel":"Arts of Ancient Greece and Rome","href":"/events/programs/tours/arts-ancient-greece-rome?eid=R021_%7bF428DBBF-911D-47C3-BF37-47C3F3F2E51E%7d_20131015123000","date":"October 15, 2013"},{"rel":"Italian Peninsula, 1–500A.D.","href":"http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/ht/?period=05®ion=eust","date":""}],"self":{"href":"/object/256911"},"source":{"href":"http://www.metmuseum.org/Collections/search-the-collections/256911"}},"assigned_for_tagging":false,"tags":{"faces":[{"center_pos":{"value":[0.4275,0.42685370741482964],"user":"Francisco"}}]}}

Although the features are cast in a thoroughly classical style typical of the late fourth century B.C., the face is stamped with enough individuality to identify it as a portrait. In all probability, it represents a member of the Ptolemaic dynasty, that succession of Macedonian Greeks who ruled Egypt from the death of Alexander the Great in 323 B.C. until the annexation of Egypt by Rome and the suicide of Cleopatra VII in 30 B.C. Most recently, the head has been identified as Arsinoe II, who ruled together with her brother, Ptolemy II, from 278 B.C. until her death in 270 B.C. Not only was the queen part of a dynastic ruler cult during her life, she was also transformed into an independent deity by her brother after her death. She was worshiped as an Egyptian goddess in association with Isis and also separately as a Greek goddess, with her own sanctuaries and festivals. This strongly idealized head, which resembles classical images of Hera and Demeter, was probably associated with the latter cult.","provenance":["Acquired in Egypt by George Baldwin, British consul-general 1785-96","sale, George Baldwin Collection, Cauty, London, May 8-9, 1828","William Richard Hamilton, London, and descendants, 1828-1976","on loan to The British Museum, London, 1953-76","sale, Sotheby's, London, July 12-13, 1976, lot 520","Mrs. Ariel Herrmann, New York, 1976-early 1980s","[McAlpine Gallery, London, early to mid-1980s]","[Thomas Colville, New York]","[Acanthus Gallery, New York]"],"links":{"related-artworks":[{"href":"http://scrapi.org/object/245539"},{"href":"http://scrapi.org/object/247004"},{"href":"http://scrapi.org/object/247172"},{"href":"http://scrapi.org/object/247989"},{"href":"http://scrapi.org/object/247985"}],"related-content":[{"rel":"Arts of Ancient Greece and Rome","href":"/events/programs/tours/arts-ancient-greece-rome?eid=R015_%7bF428DBBF-911D-47C3-BF37-47C3F3F2E51E%7d_20131004123000","date":"October 4, 2013"},{"rel":"Stone and Metal: Etruscan Art","href":"/events/programs/family-programs/sunday-studio/stone-and-metal?eid=A001_%7bC5DE7A07-5D55-4413-9233-A4C1E8A0E912%7d_20130722153815","date":"October 6, 2013"},{"rel":"Arts of Ancient Greece and Rome","href":"/events/programs/tours/arts-ancient-greece-rome?eid=A126_%7bF428DBBF-911D-47C3-BF37-47C3F3F2E51E%7d_20130812100612","date":"October 6, 2013"},{"rel":"Arts of Ancient Greece and Rome","href":"/events/programs/tours/arts-ancient-greece-rome?eid=R016_%7bF428DBBF-911D-47C3-BF37-47C3F3F2E51E%7d_20131007123000","date":"October 7, 2013"},{"rel":"Arts of Ancient Greece and Rome","href":"/events/programs/tours/arts-ancient-greece-rome?eid=R017_%7bF428DBBF-911D-47C3-BF37-47C3F3F2E51E%7d_20131008123000","date":"October 8, 2013"},{"rel":"Arts of Ancient Greece and Rome","href":"/events/programs/tours/arts-ancient-greece-rome?eid=R018_%7bF428DBBF-911D-47C3-BF37-47C3F3F2E51E%7d_20131010123000","date":"October 10, 2013"},{"rel":"Искуство Древней Греции и Рима (Arts of Ancient Greece and Rome in Russian)","href":"/events/programs/tours/arts-ancient-greece-rome-russian?eid=R005_%7b71655D2F-2D95-42B5-AC13-1F3BF3CB4904%7d_20131010130000","date":"October 10, 2013"},{"rel":"Arts of Ancient Greece and Rome","href":"/events/programs/tours/arts-ancient-greece-rome?eid=R019_%7bF428DBBF-911D-47C3-BF37-47C3F3F2E51E%7d_20131011123000","date":"October 11, 2013"},{"rel":"Friday Focus—Triumphs and Tribulations: The Growth of the Met's Etruscan Collection","href":"/events/programs/lectures-and-panels/free-lectures/triumphs-and-tribulations?eid=A001_%7b3CF62CFA-8E68-497B-B994-92779FAB332C%7d_20130719155517","date":"October 11, 2013"},{"rel":"Arts of Ancient Greece and Rome","href":"/events/programs/tours/arts-ancient-greece-rome?eid=R021_%7bF428DBBF-911D-47C3-BF37-47C3F3F2E51E%7d_20131015123000","date":"October 15, 2013"},{"rel":"Ancient Greece, 1000 B.C.–1 A.D.","href":"http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/ht/?period=04®ion=eusb","date":""}],"self":{"href":"/object/257603"},"source":{"href":"http://www.metmuseum.org/Collections/search-the-collections/257603"}},"assigned_for_tagging":false,"tags":{"faces":[{"center_pos":{"value":[0.3725,0.561122244488978],"user":"dawn barber"}}]}}

With the focus and exposure of his 35mm Contax predetermined, Evans was completely free to attend to the transient expressions and conduct of his fellow passengers.  When the right moment arrived, Evans quickly squeezed the cable release he had snaked from the camera down his sleeve to his hand.  Evans published 89 photographs from the series in Many Are Called, his 1966 monograph on passengers in the subway, introduced by his friend James Agee.  About the time of the subway series, Evans wrote: \"...these anonymous people who come and go in the cities and who move on the land; it is on what they look like now; what is in their faces and in the windows and the streets beside and around them, what they are wearing and what they are riding in, and how they are gesturing that we need to concentrate, consciously, with the camera.\"","links":{"related-artworks":[{"href":"http://scrapi.org/object/267283"},{"href":"http://scrapi.org/object/267285"},{"href":"http://scrapi.org/object/267284"},{"href":"http://scrapi.org/object/267286"},{"href":"http://scrapi.org/object/267287"}],"related-content":[{"rel":"Julia Margaret Cameron","href":"/exhibitions/listings/2013/julia-margaret-cameron","date":"From August 19, 2013"},{"rel":"Everyday Epiphanies","href":"/exhibitions/listings/2013/everyday-epiphanies","date":"From June 25, 2013"},{"rel":"Exhibition Tour—Julia Margaret Cameron","href":"/events/programs/talks/gallery-talks/julia-margaret-cameron?eid=A002_%7b47B16DC2-D9F8-4B6D-94B4-DB9E652161C8%7d_20130725154821","date":"October 4, 2013"},{"rel":"Photography Workshop: Momentos","href":"/events/programs/family-programs/fiesta-photography?eid=A001_%7b1047A253-869A-4297-A586-96B53D143796%7d_20130909105006","date":"October 5, 2013"},{"rel":"Moving through the Day: Art and the Everyday","href":"/events/programs/talks/gallery-talks/moving-through-the-day-art?eid=A002_%7b4BF00B18-E000-4E9C-A8BB-B529EE8EAC1D%7d_20130723134311","date":"October 15, 2013"},{"rel":"Exhibition Tour—Everyday Epiphanies: Photography and Daily Life Since 1969","href":"/events/programs/talks/gallery-talks/everyday-epiphanies-fm?eid=A002_%7b445C975F-7F6E-48D2-804C-7D6B060D08E4%7d_20130806200354","date":"November 15, 2013"},{"rel":"Exhibition Tour—Julia Margaret Cameron","href":"/events/programs/talks/gallery-talks/julia-margaret-cameron?eid=A003_%7b47B16DC2-D9F8-4B6D-94B4-DB9E652161C8%7d_20130725154838","date":"November 22, 2013"},{"rel":"Early Documentary Photography","href":"http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/edph/hd_edph.htm","date":""},{"rel":"Kodak and the Rise of Amateur Photography","href":"http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/kodk/hd_kodk.htm","date":""},{"rel":"Walker Evans (1903–1975)","href":"http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/evan/hd_evan.htm","date":""},{"rel":"The United States and Canada, 1900 A.D.–present","href":"http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/ht/?period=11®ion=na","date":""}],"self":{"href":"/object/259978"},"source":{"href":"http://www.metmuseum.org/Collections/search-the-collections/259978"}},"assigned_for_tagging":false,"tags":{"faces":[{"center_pos":{"value":[0.825,0.7556390977443609],"user":"Francisco"}}]}}

Nightlife scenes show her enjoying herself in a private room of a big restaurant on the boulevard or sitting forlorn in the back room of a brasserie or dance hall.

He is best known for his extended series of candid portraits of the various social types who populated the streets of Vienna in the early twentieth century: street merchants, soldiers, policemen, market women, waiters, coachmen, and window shoppers.Mayer's photographs document a short-lived period of stability and prosperity in Austria's history. The Viennese writer Stefan Zweig recalled this time in his autobiography: \"Everything had its norm, its definite measure and weight. … Every family had its fixed budget, and knew how much could be spent for rent and food, for vacations and entertainment… In this vast empire everything stood firmly and immovably in its appointed place, and at its head was the aged emperor; and were he to die, one knew (or believed) another would come to take his place, and nothing would change in the well-regulated order.\"","links":{"related-artworks":[{"href":"http://scrapi.org/object/261577"},{"href":"http://scrapi.org/object/261578"},{"href":"http://scrapi.org/object/261579"},{"href":"http://scrapi.org/object/261572"},{"href":"http://scrapi.org/object/261573"}],"related-content":[{"rel":"Julia Margaret Cameron","href":"/exhibitions/listings/2013/julia-margaret-cameron","date":"From August 19, 2013"},{"rel":"Everyday Epiphanies","href":"/exhibitions/listings/2013/everyday-epiphanies","date":"From June 25, 2013"},{"rel":"Moving through the Day: Art and the Everyday","href":"/events/programs/talks/gallery-talks/moving-through-the-day-art?eid=A002_%7b4BF00B18-E000-4E9C-A8BB-B529EE8EAC1D%7d_20130723134311","date":"October 15, 2013"},{"rel":"Exhibition Tour—Everyday Epiphanies: Photography and Daily Life Since 1969","href":"/events/programs/talks/gallery-talks/everyday-epiphanies-fm?eid=A002_%7b445C975F-7F6E-48D2-804C-7D6B060D08E4%7d_20130806200354","date":"November 15, 2013"},{"rel":"Exhibition Tour—Julia Margaret Cameron","href":"/events/programs/talks/gallery-talks/julia-margaret-cameron?eid=A003_%7b47B16DC2-D9F8-4B6D-94B4-DB9E652161C8%7d_20130725154838","date":"November 22, 2013"},{"rel":"Central Europe (Austria, Germany, and Switzerland), 1900 A.D.–present","href":"http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/ht/?period=11®ion=euwcm","date":""}],"self":{"href":"http://scrapi.org/object/261571"},"source":{"href":"http://www.metmuseum.org/Collections/search-the-collections/261571"}},"assigned_for_tagging":false,"tags":{"faces":[{"center_pos":{"value":[0.375,0.35608856088560886],"user":"anamarva@gmail.com"}}]}}

In the summer of 1974, Nicholas Nixon made a portrait of his wife, Bebe Brown, with her three sisters. Unsatisfied with the result, Nixon made another attempt the following summer, during the next family gathering. This would be the first picture of a continuing series, for the photographer and his four models decided to create the occasion for making a similar portrait each year. The Brown Sisters photographs are, in Nixon's own words, an \"annual rite of passage\": \"one picture we all liked led to a whim, which led to an idea\". This ritual tells all about passage of time and aging, as well as the deep mystery of blood ties.","links":{"related-artworks":[{"href":"http://scrapi.org/object/262923"},{"href":"http://scrapi.org/object/263623"},{"href":"http://scrapi.org/object/265056"},{"href":"http://scrapi.org/object/265874"},{"href":"http://scrapi.org/object/265876"}],"related-content":[{"rel":"Julia Margaret Cameron","href":"/exhibitions/listings/2013/julia-margaret-cameron","date":"From August 19, 2013"},{"rel":"Everyday Epiphanies","href":"/exhibitions/listings/2013/everyday-epiphanies","date":"From June 25, 2013"},{"rel":"Moving through the Day: Art and the Everyday","href":"/events/programs/talks/gallery-talks/moving-through-the-day-art?eid=A002_%7b4BF00B18-E000-4E9C-A8BB-B529EE8EAC1D%7d_20130723134311","date":"October 15, 2013"},{"rel":"Exhibition Tour—Everyday Epiphanies: Photography and Daily Life Since 1969","href":"/events/programs/talks/gallery-talks/everyday-epiphanies-fm?eid=A002_%7b445C975F-7F6E-48D2-804C-7D6B060D08E4%7d_20130806200354","date":"November 15, 2013"},{"rel":"Exhibition Tour—Julia Margaret Cameron","href":"/events/programs/talks/gallery-talks/julia-margaret-cameron?eid=A003_%7b47B16DC2-D9F8-4B6D-94B4-DB9E652161C8%7d_20130725154838","date":"November 22, 2013"},{"rel":"The United States and Canada, 1900 A.D.–present","href":"http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/ht/?period=11®ion=na","date":""}],"self":{"href":"http://scrapi.org/object/262922"},"source":{"href":"http://www.metmuseum.org/Collections/search-the-collections/262922"}},"assigned_for_tagging":false,"tags":{"faces":[{"center_pos":{"value":[0.8025,0.3894080996884735],"user":"anamarva@gmail.com"}},{"center_pos":{"value":[0.1725,0.3333333333333333],"user":"anamarva@gmail.com"}},{"center_pos":{"value":[0.4425,0.4392523364485981],"user":"anamarva@gmail.com"}},{"center_pos":{"value":[0.7075,0.4392523364485981],"user":"anamarva@gmail.com"}}]}}

After an initial stay in Cairo, the two friends hired a boat to take them up the Nile as far as the second cataract, after which they descended the river at leisure, exploring the archaeological sites along its banks. A journalist with no experience in photography, Du Camp learned the craft from Gustave Le Gray shortly before his departure for Egypt. By the time he came to Abu Simbel in March 1850 to explore the rock-cut temples built by Ramesses II (r. 1279-1213 B.C.), Du Camp was thoroughly at ease with the medium. Always in search of a neat, documentary clarity, he preferred a frontal view and midday light for this picture of one of the colossal effigies of Ramesses II. Du Camp's album Égypte, Nubie, Palestine et Syrie, in which this image appeared as plate 106, was published in 1852 and contained 125 photographs. It brought its author instant fame.","links":{"related-artworks":[{"href":"http://scrapi.org/object/283143"},{"href":"http://scrapi.org/object/283144"},{"href":"http://scrapi.org/object/283672"},{"href":"http://scrapi.org/object/285872"},{"href":"http://scrapi.org/object/286013"}],"related-content":[{"rel":"Julia Margaret Cameron","href":"/exhibitions/listings/2013/julia-margaret-cameron","date":"From August 19, 2013"},{"rel":"Everyday Epiphanies","href":"/exhibitions/listings/2013/everyday-epiphanies","date":"From June 25, 2013"},{"rel":"Moving through the Day: Art and the Everyday","href":"/events/programs/talks/gallery-talks/moving-through-the-day-art?eid=A002_%7b4BF00B18-E000-4E9C-A8BB-B529EE8EAC1D%7d_20130723134311","date":"October 15, 2013"},{"rel":"Exhibition Tour—Everyday Epiphanies: Photography and Daily Life Since 1969","href":"/events/programs/talks/gallery-talks/everyday-epiphanies-fm?eid=A002_%7b445C975F-7F6E-48D2-804C-7D6B060D08E4%7d_20130806200354","date":"November 15, 2013"},{"rel":"Exhibition Tour—Julia Margaret Cameron","href":"/events/programs/talks/gallery-talks/julia-margaret-cameron?eid=A003_%7b47B16DC2-D9F8-4B6D-94B4-DB9E652161C8%7d_20130725154838","date":"November 22, 2013"},{"rel":"Photographers in Egypt","href":"http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/treg/hd_treg.htm","date":""},{"rel":"France, 1800–1900 A.D.","href":"http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/ht/?period=10®ion=euwf","date":""}],"self":{"href":"http://scrapi.org/object/263168"},"source":{"href":"http://www.metmuseum.org/Collections/search-the-collections/263168"}},"assigned_for_tagging":false,"tags":{"faces":[{"center_pos":{"value":[0.5425,0.5739299610894941],"user":"anamarva@gmail.com"}}]}}

During the late teens he made fashion photographs for Vogue, and in 1922 he took a job with Harper's Bazaar in Paris. He made at least two portraits of the glamorous Josephine Baker (1906-1975), star of La Revue Nègre (1925) and a favorite of the Franco-American cabaret set. Baker kept a snake and a leopard for the benefit of the publicity, and she raised eyebrows with her scanty costumes and gold-painted fingernails. De Meyer presents the \"pantheress with gold claws,\" as she was called, as the glittering siren of the glittering stage, the quintessential entertainer enrobed in her performance.","links":{"related-artworks":[{"href":"http://scrapi.org/object/267300"},{"href":"http://scrapi.org/object/267637"},{"href":"http://scrapi.org/object/267636"},{"href":"http://scrapi.org/object/267639"},{"href":"http://scrapi.org/object/267640"}],"related-content":[{"rel":"Julia Margaret Cameron","href":"/exhibitions/listings/2013/julia-margaret-cameron","date":"From August 19, 2013"},{"rel":"Everyday Epiphanies","href":"/exhibitions/listings/2013/everyday-epiphanies","date":"From June 25, 2013"},{"rel":"Moving through the Day: Art and the Everyday","href":"/events/programs/talks/gallery-talks/moving-through-the-day-art?eid=A002_%7b4BF00B18-E000-4E9C-A8BB-B529EE8EAC1D%7d_20130723134311","date":"October 15, 2013"},{"rel":"Exhibition Tour—Everyday Epiphanies: Photography and Daily Life Since 1969","href":"/events/programs/talks/gallery-talks/everyday-epiphanies-fm?eid=A002_%7b445C975F-7F6E-48D2-804C-7D6B060D08E4%7d_20130806200354","date":"November 15, 2013"},{"rel":"Exhibition Tour—Julia Margaret Cameron","href":"/events/programs/talks/gallery-talks/julia-margaret-cameron?eid=A003_%7b47B16DC2-D9F8-4B6D-94B4-DB9E652161C8%7d_20130725154838","date":"November 22, 2013"},{"rel":"The United States and Canada, 1900 A.D.–present","href":"http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/ht/?period=11®ion=na","date":""}],"self":{"href":"http://scrapi.org/object/265199"},"source":{"href":"http://www.metmuseum.org/Collections/search-the-collections/265199"}},"assigned_for_tagging":false,"tags":{"faces":[{"center_pos":{"value":[0.5513784461152882,0.16666666666666666],"user":"aisencc@gmail.com"}}]}}

His international fame skyrocketed during this period, and he solidified the character of the Tramp that he had been developing since his earliest film performances. Nineteen sixteen was also the year that he met the Russian dancer Vaslav Nijinsky, who performed in Los Angeles during an American tour. In this photograph, Chaplin wears his policeman costume from Easy Street, and his assistant Charles Riesner (back left) is also in costume. The photograph, essentially a snapshot celebrity portrait, suggests the level of media attention lavished on both stars, and its unknown maker vividly conveyed the sense of occasion that characterized their meeting.","links":{"related-artworks":[{"href":"http://scrapi.org/object/267365"},{"href":"http://scrapi.org/object/270345"},{"href":"http://scrapi.org/object/270435"},{"href":"http://scrapi.org/object/271031"},{"href":"http://scrapi.org/object/271259"}],"related-content":[{"rel":"Julia Margaret Cameron","href":"/exhibitions/listings/2013/julia-margaret-cameron","date":"From August 19, 2013"},{"rel":"Everyday Epiphanies","href":"/exhibitions/listings/2013/everyday-epiphanies","date":"From June 25, 2013"},{"rel":"Moving through the Day: Art and the Everyday","href":"/events/programs/talks/gallery-talks/moving-through-the-day-art?eid=A002_%7b4BF00B18-E000-4E9C-A8BB-B529EE8EAC1D%7d_20130723134311","date":"October 15, 2013"},{"rel":"Exhibition Tour—Everyday Epiphanies: Photography and Daily Life Since 1969","href":"/events/programs/talks/gallery-talks/everyday-epiphanies-fm?eid=A002_%7b445C975F-7F6E-48D2-804C-7D6B060D08E4%7d_20130806200354","date":"November 15, 2013"},{"rel":"Exhibition Tour—Julia Margaret Cameron","href":"/events/programs/talks/gallery-talks/julia-margaret-cameron?eid=A003_%7b47B16DC2-D9F8-4B6D-94B4-DB9E652161C8%7d_20130725154838","date":"November 22, 2013"}],"self":{"href":"http://scrapi.org/object/265513"},"source":{"href":"http://www.metmuseum.org/Collections/search-the-collections/265513"}},"assigned_for_tagging":false,"tags":{"faces":[{"center_pos":{"value":[0.195,0.17689530685920576],"user":"thomp22000@gmail.com"}},{"center_pos":{"value":[0.3475,0.2888086642599278],"user":"thomp22000@gmail.com"}},{"center_pos":{"value":[0.5325,0.296028880866426],"user":"thomp22000@gmail.com"}},{"center_pos":{"value":[0.28,0.7689530685920578],"user":"thomp22000@gmail.com"}},{"center_pos":{"value":[0.4875,0.8158844765342961],"user":"thomp22000@gmail.com"}}]}}

The tilt of the camera, which pushes most of the figures in this image into the lower right corner, and the frame's abrupt bisection of the two male figures makes the lively atmosphere on the street palpable. But as is typical of Grossman, the viewer is not allowed to enjoy the scene in blissful anonymity. The direct stare of the man on the left makes us an engaged participant in the scene rather than an aloof flâneur, rendering the experience of the picture not just an aesthetic dalliance, but a social activity as well.","links":{"related-artworks":[{"href":"http://scrapi.org/object/264633"},{"href":"http://scrapi.org/object/265928"},{"href":"http://scrapi.org/object/266296"},{"href":"http://scrapi.org/object/294385"},{"href":"http://scrapi.org/object/294386"}],"related-content":[{"rel":"Julia Margaret Cameron","href":"/exhibitions/listings/2013/julia-margaret-cameron","date":"From August 19, 2013"},{"rel":"Everyday Epiphanies","href":"/exhibitions/listings/2013/everyday-epiphanies","date":"From June 25, 2013"},{"rel":"Moving through the Day: Art and the Everyday","href":"/events/programs/talks/gallery-talks/moving-through-the-day-art?eid=A002_%7b4BF00B18-E000-4E9C-A8BB-B529EE8EAC1D%7d_20130723134311","date":"October 15, 2013"},{"rel":"Exhibition Tour—Everyday Epiphanies: Photography and Daily Life Since 1969","href":"/events/programs/talks/gallery-talks/everyday-epiphanies-fm?eid=A002_%7b445C975F-7F6E-48D2-804C-7D6B060D08E4%7d_20130806200354","date":"November 15, 2013"},{"rel":"Exhibition Tour—Julia Margaret Cameron","href":"/events/programs/talks/gallery-talks/julia-margaret-cameron?eid=A003_%7b47B16DC2-D9F8-4B6D-94B4-DB9E652161C8%7d_20130725154838","date":"November 22, 2013"},{"rel":"Photography and Everyday Life in America, 1945–60","href":"http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/phev/hd_phev.htm","date":""},{"rel":"The United States and Canada, 1900 A.D.–present","href":"http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/ht/?period=11®ion=na","date":""}],"self":{"href":"http://scrapi.org/object/266295"},"source":{"href":"http://www.metmuseum.org/Collections/search-the-collections/266295"}},"assigned_for_tagging":false,"tags":{"faces":[{"center_pos":{"value":[0.68,0.5866141732283464],"user":"thomp22000@gmail.com"}},{"center_pos":{"value":[0.7625,0.5433070866141733],"user":"thomp22000@gmail.com"}},{"center_pos":{"value":[0.9075,0.5],"user":"thomp22000@gmail.com"}}]}}

He had been commissioned by the Philadelphia publisher J.B. Lippincott to make pictures for Carleton Beals's Crime of Cuba, a history of the country and an indictment of American support for Machado's regime.  Evans claimed never to have read the book, however, and would routinely distance himself from the ideological agendas of his employers.  Instead, the photographer probably looked for inspiration to the model of Eugène Atget, the great encyclopedic chronicler of another city on the cusp of historic change. Evans made over 400 negatives during his stay, collecting the city with his camera:  from street vendors and commercial signs to policemen, sleeping beggars, and the stevedores pictured here.","links":{"related-artworks":[{"href":"http://scrapi.org/object/267283"},{"href":"http://scrapi.org/object/267285"},{"href":"http://scrapi.org/object/267284"},{"href":"http://scrapi.org/object/267286"},{"href":"http://scrapi.org/object/267287"}],"related-content":[{"rel":"Julia Margaret Cameron","href":"/exhibitions/listings/2013/julia-margaret-cameron","date":"From August 19, 2013"},{"rel":"Everyday Epiphanies","href":"/exhibitions/listings/2013/everyday-epiphanies","date":"From June 25, 2013"},{"rel":"Moving through the Day: Art and the Everyday","href":"/events/programs/talks/gallery-talks/moving-through-the-day-art?eid=A002_%7b4BF00B18-E000-4E9C-A8BB-B529EE8EAC1D%7d_20130723134311","date":"October 15, 2013"},{"rel":"Exhibition Tour—Everyday Epiphanies: Photography and Daily Life Since 1969","href":"/events/programs/talks/gallery-talks/everyday-epiphanies-fm?eid=A002_%7b445C975F-7F6E-48D2-804C-7D6B060D08E4%7d_20130806200354","date":"November 15, 2013"},{"rel":"Exhibition Tour—Julia Margaret Cameron","href":"/events/programs/talks/gallery-talks/julia-margaret-cameron?eid=A003_%7b47B16DC2-D9F8-4B6D-94B4-DB9E652161C8%7d_20130725154838","date":"November 22, 2013"},{"rel":"Early Documentary Photography","href":"http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/edph/hd_edph.htm","date":""},{"rel":"Kodak and the Rise of Amateur Photography","href":"http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/kodk/hd_kodk.htm","date":""},{"rel":"Walker Evans (1903–1975)","href":"http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/evan/hd_evan.htm","date":""},{"rel":"The United States and Canada, 1900 A.D.–present","href":"http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/ht/?period=11®ion=na","date":""}],"self":{"href":"http://scrapi.org/object/266299"},"source":{"href":"http://www.metmuseum.org/Collections/search-the-collections/266299"}},"assigned_for_tagging":false,"tags":{"faces":[{"center_pos":{"value":[0.2375,0.2777777777777778],"user":"anamarva@gmail.com"}},{"center_pos":{"value":[0.5725,0.8645833333333334],"user":"anamarva@gmail.com"}}]}}

Focusing on his subjects' telling responses (here the face and hands revealing a ferocious animal spirit), Winogrand introduced a new, exceedingly confrontational style of 35mm photography.

The series can be dated 1951-52 by the programs depicted: among others, \"Strike it Rich\", \"Meet the Press\", \"The Jack Benny Program\", \"The Ed Sullivan Show (Toast of the Town)\", \"Kukla, Fran and Ollie\", \"What’s My Line\", \"The Howdy Doody Show, and \"Zoo Parade.\"  At the time, television was primarily broadcast live and was still a regional enterprise.  Media executives were testing markets while engineers worked to link the country electronically.  On November 18, 1951, the two coasts were connected and the TV age was born.  Almost immediately, the set became an indispensible piece of domestic furniture -- for some, the regular baby sitter, for others, the Friday night date.  On view are: Kukla; a rare bird from Chicago’s Lincoln Park Zoo; the 1952 Rose Bowl game [Illinois defeated Stanford 40-7]; the Tournament of Roses Queen, Nancy Thorne; Kitty Carlisle Hart; and  before a portrait of Enrico Caruso.","links":{"related-artworks":[{"href":"http://scrapi.org/object/267336"},{"href":"http://scrapi.org/object/267357"},{"href":"http://scrapi.org/object/267364"},{"href":"http://scrapi.org/object/267492"},{"href":"http://scrapi.org/object/270139"}],"related-content":[{"rel":"Julia Margaret Cameron","href":"/exhibitions/listings/2013/julia-margaret-cameron","date":"From August 19, 2013"},{"rel":"Everyday Epiphanies","href":"/exhibitions/listings/2013/everyday-epiphanies","date":"From June 25, 2013"},{"rel":"Moving through the Day: Art and the Everyday","href":"/events/programs/talks/gallery-talks/moving-through-the-day-art?eid=A002_%7b4BF00B18-E000-4E9C-A8BB-B529EE8EAC1D%7d_20130723134311","date":"October 15, 2013"},{"rel":"Exhibition Tour—Everyday Epiphanies: Photography and Daily Life Since 1969","href":"/events/programs/talks/gallery-talks/everyday-epiphanies-fm?eid=A002_%7b445C975F-7F6E-48D2-804C-7D6B060D08E4%7d_20130806200354","date":"November 15, 2013"},{"rel":"Exhibition Tour—Julia Margaret Cameron","href":"/events/programs/talks/gallery-talks/julia-margaret-cameron?eid=A003_%7b47B16DC2-D9F8-4B6D-94B4-DB9E652161C8%7d_20130725154838","date":"November 22, 2013"}],"self":{"href":"http://scrapi.org/object/266947"},"source":{"href":"http://www.metmuseum.org/Collections/search-the-collections/266947"}},"assigned_for_tagging":false,"tags":{"faces":[{"center_pos":{"value":[0.55,0.4863013698630137],"user":"dawn barber"}},{"center_pos":{"value":[0.475,0.1643835616438356],"user":"dawn barber"}}]}}

Although millions of these portraits were produced, this uncut sheet from Disdéri's archive is a rare illustration of the eight-in-one technique, of Second Empire posing, and of the public and private roles of the carte-de-visite.

In reshooting Marlboro advertisements, B-movie stills, and even classics of Modernist photography, these artists adopted dual roles as director and spectator.  In their manipulated appropriations, these artists were not only exposing and dissembling mass-media fictions, but enacting more complicated scenarios of desire, identification, and loss.\tIn 1981, Levine photographed reproductions of Depression-era photographs by Walker Evans, such as this famous portrait of a family of Alabama sharecroppers.  The series, entitled After Walker Evans, became a landmark of postmodernism, both praised and attacked as a feminist hijacking of patriarchal authority, a critique of the commodification of art, and an elegy on the death of modernism.

Instead of being heroicized, as cultural icons are expected to be, she appears slightly bashful and unsure, posing with tomboyish awkwardness in front of her single-engine Lockheed Vega at Wheeler Field, Hawaii.  On January 11, 1935, seven days after this photograph was taken, Earhart made her historic solo flight in this plane from Hawaii to Oakland, California--the first solo flight from Hawaii to the mainland.  Two years later, she disappeared during an attempt to become the first woman to circumnavigate the globe.","links":{"related-artworks":[{"href":"http://scrapi.org/object/267357"},{"href":"http://scrapi.org/object/267364"},{"href":"http://scrapi.org/object/267492"},{"href":"http://scrapi.org/object/270139"},{"href":"http://scrapi.org/object/270907"}],"related-content":[{"rel":"Julia Margaret Cameron","href":"/exhibitions/listings/2013/julia-margaret-cameron","date":"From August 19, 2013"},{"rel":"Everyday Epiphanies","href":"/exhibitions/listings/2013/everyday-epiphanies","date":"From June 25, 2013"},{"rel":"Moving through the Day: Art and the Everyday","href":"/events/programs/talks/gallery-talks/moving-through-the-day-art?eid=A002_%7b4BF00B18-E000-4E9C-A8BB-B529EE8EAC1D%7d_20130723134311","date":"October 15, 2013"},{"rel":"Exhibition Tour—Everyday Epiphanies: Photography and Daily Life Since 1969","href":"/events/programs/talks/gallery-talks/everyday-epiphanies-fm?eid=A002_%7b445C975F-7F6E-48D2-804C-7D6B060D08E4%7d_20130806200354","date":"November 15, 2013"},{"rel":"Exhibition Tour—Julia Margaret Cameron","href":"/events/programs/talks/gallery-talks/julia-margaret-cameron?eid=A003_%7b47B16DC2-D9F8-4B6D-94B4-DB9E652161C8%7d_20130725154838","date":"November 22, 2013"}],"self":{"href":"http://scrapi.org/object/267336"},"source":{"href":"http://www.metmuseum.org/Collections/search-the-collections/267336"}},"assigned_for_tagging":false,"tags":{"faces":[{"center_pos":{"value":[0.42,0.24603174603174602],"user":"aisencc@gmail.com"}}]}}

That day, Stieglitz bought this photograph, along with two other platinum prints, for five dollars apiece, telling his young visitor, \"I am robbing you at that.\" In this eccentric self-portrait of the artist as a young dandy, Steichen seems poised at a threshhold, hovering half-in and half-out of the frame. Much like Whistler, Steichen used the portrait as a vehicle for exploring abstract elements of design, cleverly punctuating the white wall behind him with a tiny empty picture frame.","links":{"related-artworks":[{"href":"http://scrapi.org/object/267538"},{"href":"http://scrapi.org/object/267868"},{"href":"http://scrapi.org/object/269358"},{"href":"http://scrapi.org/object/267560"},{"href":"http://scrapi.org/object/267616"}],"related-content":[{"rel":"Julia Margaret Cameron","href":"/exhibitions/listings/2013/julia-margaret-cameron","date":"From August 19, 2013"},{"rel":"Everyday Epiphanies","href":"/exhibitions/listings/2013/everyday-epiphanies","date":"From June 25, 2013"},{"rel":"Exhibition Tour—Julia Margaret Cameron","href":"/events/programs/talks/gallery-talks/julia-margaret-cameron?eid=A002_%7b47B16DC2-D9F8-4B6D-94B4-DB9E652161C8%7d_20130725154821","date":"October 4, 2013"},{"rel":"Photography Workshop: Momentos","href":"/events/programs/family-programs/fiesta-photography?eid=A001_%7b1047A253-869A-4297-A586-96B53D143796%7d_20130909105006","date":"October 5, 2013"},{"rel":"Moving through the Day: Art and the Everyday","href":"/events/programs/talks/gallery-talks/moving-through-the-day-art?eid=A002_%7b4BF00B18-E000-4E9C-A8BB-B529EE8EAC1D%7d_20130723134311","date":"October 15, 2013"},{"rel":"Exhibition Tour—Everyday Epiphanies: Photography and Daily Life Since 1969","href":"/events/programs/talks/gallery-talks/everyday-epiphanies-fm?eid=A002_%7b445C975F-7F6E-48D2-804C-7D6B060D08E4%7d_20130806200354","date":"November 15, 2013"},{"rel":"Exhibition Tour—Julia Margaret Cameron","href":"/events/programs/talks/gallery-talks/julia-margaret-cameron?eid=A003_%7b47B16DC2-D9F8-4B6D-94B4-DB9E652161C8%7d_20130725154838","date":"November 22, 2013"},{"rel":"Edward Steichen (1879–1973): The Photo–Secession Years","href":"http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/stei/hd_stei.htm","date":""},{"rel":"The United States and Canada, 1800–1900 A.D.","href":"http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/ht/?period=10®ion=na","date":""}],"self":{"href":"/object/267493"},"source":{"href":"http://www.metmuseum.org/Collections/search-the-collections/267493"}},"assigned_for_tagging":false,"tags":{"faces":[{"center_pos":{"value":[0.6190476190476191,0.23],"user":"aisencc@gmail.com"}}]}}

These three photographs illustrate the range of the imagery and its progression from the most formal and demure image in which the draped Miss Thompson assumes a cool classical pose to the second image which is surprisingly intimate and unaffected.  Combining the compositional strength and naturalism of the first two photographs, but exchanging props and interior surroundings for tight framing and expressive chiaroscuro, the third and most accomplished photograph is both modern and sensual.

Exposed in a camera obscura and developed in mercury vapors, each highly polished silver plate is a unique photograph that, viewed in proper light, exhibits extraordinary detail and three-dimensionality.\tThis mesmerizing portrait would also seem to be an allegory of allegiance, in which the young girl directs the viewer’s attention back to the iconic painting of George Washington.  Recent scholarship suggests that this daguerreotype is actually a copy of another daguerreotype--adding further to the complex play of gazes--but as yet the subject and exact meaning of this enigmatic image are not known.","links":{"related-artworks":[{"href":"http://scrapi.org/object/268306"},{"href":"http://scrapi.org/object/268308"},{"href":"http://scrapi.org/object/268310"},{"href":"http://scrapi.org/object/268314"},{"href":"http://scrapi.org/object/268315"}],"related-content":[{"rel":"Julia Margaret Cameron","href":"/exhibitions/listings/2013/julia-margaret-cameron","date":"From August 19, 2013"},{"rel":"Everyday Epiphanies","href":"/exhibitions/listings/2013/everyday-epiphanies","date":"From June 25, 2013"},{"rel":"Exhibition Tour—Julia Margaret Cameron","href":"/events/programs/talks/gallery-talks/julia-margaret-cameron?eid=A002_%7b47B16DC2-D9F8-4B6D-94B4-DB9E652161C8%7d_20130725154821","date":"October 4, 2013"},{"rel":"Photography Workshop: Momentos","href":"/events/programs/family-programs/fiesta-photography?eid=A001_%7b1047A253-869A-4297-A586-96B53D143796%7d_20130909105006","date":"October 5, 2013"},{"rel":"Moving through the Day: Art and the Everyday","href":"/events/programs/talks/gallery-talks/moving-through-the-day-art?eid=A002_%7b4BF00B18-E000-4E9C-A8BB-B529EE8EAC1D%7d_20130723134311","date":"October 15, 2013"},{"rel":"Exhibition Tour—Everyday Epiphanies: Photography and Daily Life Since 1969","href":"/events/programs/talks/gallery-talks/everyday-epiphanies-fm?eid=A002_%7b445C975F-7F6E-48D2-804C-7D6B060D08E4%7d_20130806200354","date":"November 15, 2013"},{"rel":"Exhibition Tour—Julia Margaret Cameron","href":"/events/programs/talks/gallery-talks/julia-margaret-cameron?eid=A003_%7b47B16DC2-D9F8-4B6D-94B4-DB9E652161C8%7d_20130725154838","date":"November 22, 2013"},{"rel":"The United States and Canada, 1800–1900 A.D.","href":"http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/ht/?period=10®ion=na","date":""}],"self":{"href":"/object/268354"},"source":{"href":"http://www.metmuseum.org/Collections/search-the-collections/268354"}},"assigned_for_tagging":false,"tags":{"faces":[{"center_pos":{"value":[0.54,0.383399209486166],"user":"adam.vigiano@gmail.com"}}]}}

Two years later, in February 1838, she and Cameron were married in Calcutta. In the following decade, Charles rose to the positions of president of the Calcutta Council of Education and member of the Supreme Council of India, and Julia Margaret played an increasingly important role in social and diplomatic circles of British India. When Charles retired in 1848, he, Julia Margaret, and their six children moved to England, where three of her sisters were already living in or near London.  Charles was frequently pressed into service as a photographic model—not only for straightforward portraits such as this one but also for his wife’s more theatrical pictures.

This striking portrait of the brooding poet by Carjat is perhaps the best known, for it was published in the widely distributed series entitled Galerie contemporaine, littéraire, artistique.The Galerie contemporaine is a high point in photographic publishing. Issued in parts from 1876 to 1884 by the firm of Goupil, the series contained 241 portraits of leading figures from the worlds of art, literature, music, science, and politics by a host of Parisian photographers. The illustrations were printed as woodburytypes-a photomechanical process that reproduced the continuous tones of photography but did so with printer's ink. The speed and economy with which woodburytypes could be printed, as well as their permanence (unlike traditional photographic processes that were subject to fading), made them a highly practical substitute for albumen silver prints in book publication or other situations where mass production was desirable.","links":{"related-artworks":[{"href":"http://scrapi.org/object/266788"},{"href":"http://scrapi.org/object/266789"},{"href":"http://scrapi.org/object/266793"},{"href":"http://scrapi.org/object/266801"},{"href":"http://scrapi.org/object/266803"}],"related-content":[{"rel":"Julia Margaret Cameron","href":"/exhibitions/listings/2013/julia-margaret-cameron","date":"From August 19, 2013"},{"rel":"Everyday Epiphanies","href":"/exhibitions/listings/2013/everyday-epiphanies","date":"From June 25, 2013"},{"rel":"Moving through the Day: Art and the Everyday","href":"/events/programs/talks/gallery-talks/moving-through-the-day-art?eid=A002_%7b4BF00B18-E000-4E9C-A8BB-B529EE8EAC1D%7d_20130723134311","date":"October 15, 2013"},{"rel":"Exhibition Tour—Everyday Epiphanies: Photography and Daily Life Since 1969","href":"/events/programs/talks/gallery-talks/everyday-epiphanies-fm?eid=A002_%7b445C975F-7F6E-48D2-804C-7D6B060D08E4%7d_20130806200354","date":"November 15, 2013"},{"rel":"Exhibition Tour—Julia Margaret Cameron","href":"/events/programs/talks/gallery-talks/julia-margaret-cameron?eid=A003_%7b47B16DC2-D9F8-4B6D-94B4-DB9E652161C8%7d_20130725154838","date":"November 22, 2013"},{"rel":"The Industrialization of French Photography after 1860","href":"http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/infp/hd_infp.htm","date":""},{"rel":"France, 1800–1900 A.D.","href":"http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/ht/?period=10®ion=euwf","date":""}],"self":{"href":"http://scrapi.org/object/270956"},"source":{"href":"http://www.metmuseum.org/Collections/search-the-collections/270956"}},"assigned_for_tagging":false,"tags":{"faces":[{"center_pos":{"value":[0.4325,0.45454545454545453],"user":"Francisco"}}]}}
